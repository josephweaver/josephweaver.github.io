# How I Survived My Probability Prelim  
*(working title, promotion contingent on outcome)*

## Concept Page

### Elevator pitch
This is a short, memoir-esque essay about surviving a PhD probability prelim, written from the inside, not as a victory lap, but as a field guide. It is part narrative, part technical reflection, and part protest against the myth that prelim success is purely about raw intelligence or encyclopedic recall.

If the exam goes very well, the title may be upgraded to:

> **How I Not Only Survived My Probability Prelim**

This contingency is intentional and part of the tone.

## Core thesis

Prelims do not test whether you can think freely or creatively.  
They test whether you can **think inside a box under pressure**.

Research is about building boxes.  
Prelims are about finding them quickly and not breaking the walls.

Most failure modes come not from lack of knowledge, but from:
- misidentifying the box,
- entering the wrong box,
- or refusing to enter one at all.

---

## Intended audience

- PhD students preparing for probability or statistics prelims
- Students who “know the material” but freeze on exams
- People who think structurally, analogically, or too broadly
- Anyone who has ever said: “I don’t know what they want”

This is **not** a how-to for first exposure to probability theory.

---

## Tone and style

- First-person, reflective, occasionally dryly funny
- Honest about confusion, frustration, and overthinking
- Minimal motivational fluff
- Technical where necessary, but never performative
- Written for stressed readers with limited cognitive bandwidth

Think:
- calm,
- precise,
- slightly amused by the absurdity of the process.

## Structural outline (tentative)

### 1. The problem with being good at math
- Thinking outside the box is rewarded everywhere except prelims
- How pattern-seeking and abstraction become liabilities
- The mismatch between training and testing

### 2. The exam is not adversarial (but it feels like it)
- What prelim writers are actually doing
- Why problems are scaffolded into parts (a), (b), (c)
- How to read the problem as a guided corridor, not a maze

### 3. The box heuristic
- “What do I know?”
- “What do I need to show?”
- How this defines the box
- Why writing this down matters more than you think

### 4. The 30-second orientation pass
- Offish targeting as a survival skill
- How to aim before you prove
- Targets as expressions vs targets as theorems
- Why this is not hand-waving

### 5. Common failure modes (and how I fell into them)
- Over-rigor
- Premature generalization
- Using the right theorem for the wrong reason
- Forgetting what the question actually asked

### 6. Brownian motion as a psychological test
- Why Brownian motion problems feel harder than they are
- Covariance kernels, Fubini, and ritual incantations
- Learning to stop once the target appears

### 7. Writing for graders, not for posterity
- What “enough rigor” actually means
- When to quote a theorem instead of reproving it
- How to leave breadcrumbs for partial credit

### 8. Aftermath
- What changed about how I think
- What did not
- Why I still like probability despite everything

## Relationship to other work

This essay is a companion to:
- my Probability Prelim Survival Guide,
- annotated solutions to past prelims,
- and structured “orientation + solution” writeups.

It focuses on **process**, not solutions.

---

## What this is not

- Not a complaint letter
- Not an exam prep manual
- Not a list of tricks
- Not a motivational manifesto

It is a record of learning how to **aim**, under constraints, without losing oneself.

---

## Closing note (to the reader)

If you are reading this before your prelim:
- You are not broken.
- You are probably not underprepared.
- You are likely missing orientation, not content.

I wish someone had written this for me.

So I did.
