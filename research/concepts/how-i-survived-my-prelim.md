# How I Survived My Probability Prelim  
## An Applied Toolkit (with Field Notes)

*(working title, subject to outcome and revisionism)*

---

## What this is

This document combines two things that are usually kept separate:

1. A **Probability Prelim Survival Guide**  
2. A **memoir-esque record of what actually worked under pressure**

Together, they form an **applied toolkit**.

This is not a polished reference text.  
This is not a motivational essay.  
This is not a collection of clever tricks.

It is a record of **what I tried, what failed, what worked**, and why those things worked *in the specific context of a probability prelim*.

The tone is intentionally dry. Any humor is incidental.

---

## The organizing idea

Most prelim resources focus on solving problems.

This toolkit focuses on something upstream:

> **How to figure out what kind of problem this is, quickly enough to solve it under exam constraints.**

Prelims reward correctness, but they punish misorientation more than ignorance.

---

## The core claim

Prelims are not tests of creativity or depth.  
They are tests of **controlled reasoning inside a constrained box**.

Research rewards building boxes.  
Prelims reward finding the right one and not leaving it.

Most failure modes come from:
- entering the wrong box,
- expanding the box unnecessarily,
- or refusing to acknowledge that a box exists.

---

## Why combine a Survival Guide and a memoir

Separately:
- a Survival Guide risks feeling mechanical,
- a memoir risks feeling anecdotal.

Combined:
- tools are grounded in lived failure and adjustment,
- reflection is anchored to concrete technique,
- abstraction is justified by application.

The result is not inspiration, it is **transfer**.

## How each entry is structured

Each problem or topic follows the same applied pattern.

### 1. Orientation (30-second pass)
A deliberately incomplete, pre-proof phase.

- What kind of object is this?
- What tools are likely relevant?
- What does the grader probably expect?
- What is the *offish target*?

This section is about **aiming**, not justifying.  
It is explicitly non-rigorous by design.

---

### 2. The box
A precise statement of:
- what is given,
- what must be shown,
- what tools are allowed or relevant.

If the solution fails later, it is usually because the box was misidentified here.

---

### 3. Tools inventory
A short, constrained list of:
- theorems,
- identities,
- structural facts,

that are actually needed.

This is not a brain dump.  
It is a commitment to *not* using everything else.

---

### 4. Execution
A clean, exam-facing solution.

- Minimal prose
- No unnecessary generality
- Theorem names instead of re-proofs when allowed
- Stops as soon as the target is reached

This section is written for graders, not posterity.

---

### 5. Postmortem (field notes)
What happened in practice.

- Where I overthought
- Where I almost left the box
- Where a small recognition saved time
- What I would change next time

This is the applied part most resources omit.

---

## Recurring tools and patterns

These appear repeatedly, by design:

- “What do I know / what do I show”
- Offish targets (expressions vs theorems)
- The 30-second orientation pass
- Recognizing when Fubini is the point vs when it is a formality
- Knowing when measurability is being tested
- Stopping early without guilt

The repetition is intentional. Pattern recognition is the skill.

---

## Tone contract with the reader

- I will not pretend this was easy.
- I will not retroactively hide confusion.
- I will not exaggerate cleverness.
- I will not claim universality.

What worked for me worked **under these constraints**, on **these exams**, with **this background**.

Your mileage may vary. The map is still useful.

---

## Who this is for

- People who “know probability” but freeze on exams
- People whose instinct is to generalize too early
- People who over-rigor before orienting
- People who suspect the problem is not content but control

If you want a textbook, this is not it.

If you want to see how someone learned to aim under pressure, it might help.

## Closing note

I did not become a different thinker to pass my prelim.

I learned when not to be one.

That distinction turned out to matter.
