# Hello to everybody and nobody

If you found this corner of the internet, congratulations: you've wandered into a blog that says hi to everyone and, simultaneously, absolutely no one. Consider this your friendly warning label. My sense of humor is extremely absurd, often pulp-adjacent, and occasionally tests what counts as "appropriate" in polite company. I’ll try to keep things professional-ish—though, if we’re being honest, “professional” usually means “I like this person, they’re professional” or “I don’t like this person, clearly they’re not.” 

## What changed today

- The site now lands on this blog, with a refreshed front page to surface new posts and topic areas.
- The old homepage has been moved to an About page (`/about.html`) so the biographical sketch and CV/Resume links remain easy to find.
- Navigation now clearly separates Blog (home) from About, with existing sections (Probability, Research, Fiction) intact.

## What to expect here

Notes, experiments, and teaching-ready snippets on Bayesian crop-risk modeling, geospatial data pipelines, intrinsic dimension, and anything else that seems fun (or strange) enough to share.
