# Work Notes / Inside the System

I keep coming back to a moment in SLC Punk!. Matthew Lillard’s character spends most of the movie rejecting the system outright, only to end up going to law school. Not as a betrayal, but as a realization: if you want to change how something behaves, you eventually have to understand it from the inside.

That idea feels increasingly relevant as I work on AI. I’m not blind to the fact that these tools will disrupt people who didn’t ask for it. I don’t have a clean resolution to that. What I do believe is that the direction things move is shaped most by the people closest to the machinery. Disagreement matters more when it’s informed.

Today was a good reminder that leverage shows up at many scales. One hour of weight training bought me back several hours of focus, better mood, and a genuinely productive meeting. That trade still feels suspiciously good, but I’ll take it.

On the work side, I spent time pushing forward on the Landcore Data Catalog. It’s quiet infrastructure work, but that’s the point. Clear contracts, explicit assumptions, and a shared vocabulary do more to improve downstream decisions than any single clever model.

I also revisited probability prelim prep. The strategy is holding: triage first, recognize patterns early, externalize memory aggressively. The goal isn’t mastery in the abstract, it’s judgment under constraint.

My days tend to look like this: ideas jumping domains, the same pattern resurfacing in different clothes. That’s not an accident. This space is less a polished essay series and more a set of working notes from inside the system.
