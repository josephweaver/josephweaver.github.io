**Prolifica**: a fabled land where people are always prolific and create at their maximum potential.

I touched Prolifica today.

Jammed out to chill electronica. Kind of a contradiction, but for me this is just more evidence that reality does not actually contain contradictions, contradiction is a purely logical construct.

Picked up yoga again. I like the *Yoga with Adriene* series on YouTube. This is going to hurt tomorrow.

Wrote three concept notes:
- [Hybrid Gaussian–ReLU Networks](/research/concepts/hybrid-gaussian-relu-networks)
- [Gaussian Smoothing Neural Networks](/research/concepts/gaussian-smoothing-neural-networks)
- [How I Survived My Prelim](/research/concepts/how-i-survived-my-prelim)

Updated the 24-System playtest rules:
- [24-System README](/fiction/24system/)

Created additional entries for the Probability Survival Guide:
- [Convergence](/probability/convergence/)

Then reviewed several probability problems for prelim prep.

Today’s goal was to practice *offish* problem solving.

Yes, you read that right. By *offish* I mean attempting to get an idea of the solution without worrying about criteria, restrictions, or violations. This is purely an Occam’s Razor phenomenon. As it turns out, the offish answer and the actual answer are the same about 80% of the time.

Not necessarily in that order. 🙂

Then I realized it was only 3:00 p.m.

That’s what I call productivity.
