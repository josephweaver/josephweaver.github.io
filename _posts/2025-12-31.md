title: Putting the Smoke Back in the Capacitor

Have you ever tried a math problem, only to have a capacitor in your brain go *puff* due to ambiguity? That was my day. The good news is I think I found a way to put the smoke back in the capacitor.

The fix is a two-step disambiguation procedure:

1. Find a simple fact  
2. Check types  

This sounds trivial. It is not. It works.

## Disambiguation Rule 1: Find a Simple Fact

When a problem starts to feel ambiguous, stop trying to understand the most complicated object on the page. Instead, identify the **simplest explicitly defined construct** and anchor everything to it.

For example, in Problem 3 from the 2017 prelim, the problem is set in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and defines:

- \(X(x,y) = x\)
- \(\mathcal{F} = \sigma(X)\)
- \(A \in \mathcal{F}\)
- \(\bar{A} = \{ X(a) : a \in A \}\)

At this point it is very tempting to start by asking, “What kind of object is \(A \in \sigma(X)\)?” That is exactly the wrong place to start.

Instead, anchor on the simplest fact:

\[
X(x,y) = x.
\]

This is concrete. It acts on points. Nothing abstract yet.

Now, if we ever see an expression like \(X(a)\), then \(a\) must be a valid input to \(X\). Since \(X\) maps points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), this immediately forces

\[
a = (x,y).
\]

No guesswork. No philosophy. Just type matching.

## Disambiguation Rule 2: Check Types

Once you know what kind of object \(a\) is, everything else follows mechanically.

- If \(a\) is a **point**,  
- then \(A\) is a **set of points**,  
- then \(\mathcal{F}\) is a **collection of sets of points**,  
- and \(\sigma(X)\) consists of preimages under \(X\).

In this example, since \(X(x,y) = x\), the sets in \(\sigma(X)\) are exactly those that depend only on the \(x\)-coordinate. Geometrically, they are vertical strips in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

At this point, the definition of \(\bar{A} = \{ X(a) : a \in A \}\) is no longer mysterious. It is simply the projection of \(A\) onto the \(x\)-axis.

Once the types line up, the notation stops being scary. If the types do not line up, then something has been misread, either a symbol, a definition, or occasionally the exam itself.

## The Meta-Lesson

When notation starts to melt your brain, do not wrestle with the most abstract object on the page. That is how you lose time and confidence.

Instead:

- Find the simplest explicitly defined fact.
- Push that fact through the rest of the problem.
- Check that the types align at every step.

If they do, the ambiguity evaporates. If they do not, you now know *exactly* where the problem is.

That is how you keep the smoke inside the capacitor.
