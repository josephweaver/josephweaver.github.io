**Happy New Year! Less than 10 days until the prelim. Happy!?**

I’ve been disassembling past prelim problems for a while now, and I’ve noticed something interesting: almost every exam has issues. Sometimes a hypothesis is missing. Sometimes a condition is misstated. Sometimes something is quietly impossible as written.

Under the benefit of the doubt, I assume the exam writer accidentally omitted something or transposed a condition. My more suspicious side wonders whether this is sometimes deliberate, a clever way to see how you react to ambiguity or contradictory statements.

Here’s the thing: **it doesn’t matter how the error came about**. What matters is how you handle it, and you handle all of these situations in exactly the same way.

You say:

    As stated, the claim is false. For example, take …

If time permits, you then solve the problem *as if it had been specified correctly*:

    The result would hold if instead …

Do **not**—I repeat, **do not**—silently add the missing assumption and proceed as if nothing is wrong. That earns zero points. You haven’t solved *their* problem, you’ve solved a different one without telling anyone.

Think of this like a stage play where Hamlet comes out missing the skull. The actor doesn’t mime around it and hope the audience doesn’t notice. He still says, “Alas, poor Yorick,” to his empty hand, making it clear that the prop is missing and letting the audience judge his performance *with that context*.

Your job on the prelim is the same: **acknowledge the missing piece, then perform anyway**.
