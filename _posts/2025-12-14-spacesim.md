# Weekend Weirdness: Materials, Nozzles, and Letting the Systems Breathe

This weekend I deliberately let myself drift into what I call **Weekend Weirdness**.

No roadmap pressure, no MVP anxiety, no “is this shippable?” voice in my head. Just systems, structure, and curiosity.

What came out of it was unexpectedly solid.

## What I Worked On

### 1. A Real Materials System (Not Just “Iron + Copper”)
I locked down a Tier 0 materials model that treats materials as *emergent*, not collectible tokens.

Materials are generated deterministically from planet and node context, scored across multiple properties, and constrained so they always have:
- one dominant strength
- one meaningful weakness

This makes early engineering about compromise, not optimization.

---

### 2. Visuals That Come From Data, Not Art Grind
Instead of hand-authoring textures for every fictional compound, I designed a system where:
- raw ore looks messy
- refined stock looks cleaner
- manufactured parts look machined and heat-stressed

All driven from the same material data.

Paint exists as a cosmetic overlay, not a reality eraser.

---

### 3. Rocket Nozzles as Derived Geometry
I finally committed to a derived nozzle model.

Rather than specifying throat size directly, nozzles are defined by:
- thrust
- chamber pressure
- expansion ratio
- environment

From that, the geometry falls out.

This keeps gameplay, visuals, and later physics aligned without rewriting everything.

## Why This Matters (to Me)
This weekend felt like reclaiming why I like building systems.

Not chasing polish.
Not worrying about names.
Not shipping.

Just asking:
> “If this *had* to grow later, would it survive?”

For the first time in a while, the answer feels like “yes”.

## What’s Next
Next session is implementation-heavy:
- procedural nozzle mesh generation
- profile sampling
- revolve mesh builder
- editor-time regeneration

But for now, I’m stopping while things still feel clean.

That’s Weekend Weirdness done right.
