[2023 Probability Prelim Exam (PDF)](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/_assets/files/graduate-programs/Prelim%20Prob%20Exam%202023.pdf)

## Problem statement :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Let $\{B_t, t \ge 0\}$ be a standard Brownian motion (SBM) equipped with its canonical 
filtration $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t\ge0}$.

Let $X$ be a random variable which gets exactly 3 distinct and non-zero values denoted 
by $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^3$. Also let $A_k = \{X = x_k\}$, with $P(A_k) = p_k > 0$, $k=1,2,3$. 
Assume that $E(X) = 0$.

---

**(a)** Let $\mathcal{G} = \sigma\{A_1, A_2 \cup A_3\}$ and denote $Y = E(X \mid \mathcal{G})$.

(i) How many values does $Y$ get? What is $E(Y)$? What can you say about the event $\{X = Y\}$?

(ii) Use the symbols $\{x_k, p_k\}$, $k=1,2,3$, to present the explicit distribution of $Y$.

---

**(b)** Define a stopping time with respect to the SBM filtration, denoted by $\tau_1$, 
so we have $Y = B_{\tau_1}$ in distribution. Prove your answer.

---

**(c)** Find a stopping time with respect to the SBM filtration, denoted by $\tau_2$, so that

(i) $X = B_{\tau_2}$ in distribution, and  

(ii) $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$, a.s.

*Hint.* Differentiate between the events $\{X = Y\}$ and $\{X \ne Y\}$. Also, let 
$Z_t = B_{\tau_1 + t}, t \ge 0$. By the strong Markov property, $Z_t - B_{\tau_1}$, $t \ge 0$, 
is a SBM which is independent of $\mathcal{F}_{\tau_1}$.

## (a) Conditional expectation with a coarse σ-algebra

### (a)(i) Conditional expectation and basic properties

#### Claim.  

Let $\mathcal{G} = \sigma\{A_1, A_2 \cup A_3\}$ and $Y = E(X \mid \mathcal{G})$. Then:

1. $Y$ takes exactly **two** distinct values, one on $A_1$ and one on $A_2 \cup A_3$.
2. $E(Y) = E(X) = 0$.
3. On $A_1$ we have $X = Y$ a.s., and on $A_2 \cup A_3$ in general $X \ne Y$ except in degenerate cases.

#### Proof.

By definition,
- $X = x_k$ on $A_k$, with $P(A_k) = p_k > 0$, $k=1,2,3$.
- $\mathcal{G}$ has atoms $A_1$ and $A_2 \cup A_3$.

Since $E(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ is constant on each atom of $\mathcal{G}$, there exist constants $y_1,y_2$ such that
$$
Y(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
y_1, & \omega \in A_1,\\
y_2, & \omega \in A_2 \cup A_3.
\end{cases}
$$

On $A_1$, $X$ is deterministically $x_1$, so
$$
Y = E(X \mid A_1) = x_1 \quad\text{on } A_1.
$$
Hence $y_1 = x_1$.

On $A_2 \cup A_3$,
$$
Y = E(X \mid A_2 \cup A_3)
= \frac{x_2 P(A_2) + x_3 P(A_3)}{P(A_2 \cup A_3)}
= \frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}.
$$
So $y_2 = \dfrac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}$.

Thus $Y$ takes exactly two values: $x_1$ on $A_1$ and $y_2$ on $A_2 \cup A_3$.

For the expectation:
$$
E(Y) = E(E(X \mid \mathcal{G})) = E(X) = 0.
$$

Regarding $\{X = Y\}$:
- On $A_1$, $X = x_1 = Y$.
- On $A_2$ and $A_3$, $X$ takes the values $x_2$ or $x_3$, while $Y$ is the constant $y_2$ on $A_2 \cup A_3$.
  In general $x_2 \ne y_2$ and $x_3 \ne y_2$, so on $A_2 \cup A_3$ we typically have $X \ne Y$.

So at least
$$
P(X = Y) \ge P(A_1) = p_1,
$$
and in generic non-degenerate situations $P(X=Y) = p_1$.

#### Conclusion.

- $Y$ has exactly two values: $x_1$ and $y_2 = \dfrac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}$.
- $E(Y) = 0$.
- Almost surely, $X = Y$ on $A_1$, and $X \ne Y$ on most of $A_2 \cup A_3$.

---

### (a)(ii) Explicit distribution of $Y$

#### Claim.  

The distribution of $Y$ is:
$$
P(Y = x_1) = p_1, 
\qquad 
P\!\left(Y = \frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}\right) = p_2 + p_3.
$$

#### Proof.

We already identified the values:

- On $A_1$, $Y = x_1$.
- On $A_2 \cup A_3$, $Y = \dfrac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}$.

Hence,
$$
P(Y = x_1) = P(A_1) = p_1,
$$
and
$$
P\!\left(Y = \frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}\right)
= P(A_2 \cup A_3) = p_2 + p_3.
$$

By construction,
$$
E(Y) = x_1 p_1 + \left(\frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}\right)(p_2 + p_3)
= x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3 = E(X) = 0.
$$

#### Conclusion.

$Y$ is a **two-point** mean-zero random variable with values $x_1$ and
$$
y_2 := \frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3},
$$
and probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2 + p_3$.

## (b) Representing $Y$ as $B_{\tau_1}$

### Claim.  

There exists a stopping time $\tau_1$ for the Brownian motion such that
$$
B_{\tau_1} \overset{d}{=} Y.
$$

### Proof.

From part (a)(ii), $Y$ is mean zero and takes two values:
$$
Y =
\begin{cases}
x_1, & \text{with prob. } p_1,\\[3pt]
y_2, & \text{with prob. } p_2+p_3,
\end{cases}
$$
where $x_1\ne 0$, $y_2\ne 0$, and $x_1 \neq y_2$.

We can (and will) assume $x_1 < 0 < y_2$ by re-labeling indices if needed.

Consider the hitting time
$$
\tau_1 = \inf\{ t \ge 0 : B_t \in \{x_1, y_2\}\}.
$$

1. **Stopping time and boundedness.**  
   $\tau_1$ is a stopping time with respect to $\{\mathcal{F}_t\}$, and since $B_t$ started at $0$ must hit either level $x_1$ or $y_2$ almost surely, and these levels are finite, $\tau_1$ is almost surely finite, and $B_{\tau_1}\in\{x_1,y_2\}$.

2. **Optional stopping and probabilities.**  
   Since $(B_t)$ is a martingale and $B_{\tau_1}$ is bounded, the optional stopping theorem (OST) gives
   $$ 
   E(B_{\tau_1}) = E(B_0) = 0.
   $$
   Write
   $$
   P(B_{\tau_1} = x_1) = q_1, 
   \qquad
   P(B_{\tau_1} = y_2) = q_2 = 1 - q_1.
   $$
   Then
   $$
   0 = E(B_{\tau_1}) 
     = x_1 q_1 + y_2 (1-q_1)
     = y_2 + q_1(x_1 - y_2).
   $$
   Solving for $q_1$,
   $$
   q_1 = \frac{y_2}{y_2 - x_1}, \qquad
   q_2 = 1 - q_1 = \frac{-x_1}{y_2 - x_1}.
   $$

3. **Matching with $Y$.**  
   Since $Y$ is also a mean-zero two-point random variable supported on $\{x_1,y_2\}$, its probabilities must satisfy exactly the same relations:
   $$
   x_1 p_1 + y_2 (p_2 + p_3) = 0
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   p_1 = \frac{y_2}{y_2 - x_1},\quad p_2 + p_3 = \frac{-x_1}{y_2 - x_1}.
   $$
   Hence
   $$
   P(Y = x_1) = p_1 = q_1, 
   \quad
   P(Y = y_2) = p_2 + p_3 = q_2.
   $$

Therefore, $B_{\tau_1}$ and $Y$ have the same two-point distribution.

### Conclusion.

The stopping time
$$
\tau_1 = \inf\{ t \ge 0 : B_t \in\{x_1,y_2\}\}
$$
satisfies $B_{\tau_1} \overset{d}{=} Y$.

---

## (c) Representing $X$ as $B_{\tau_2}$ with $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$

### (c)(i) Constructing the 3-point stopping time

#### Claim.  

There exists a stopping time $\tau_2$ such that
$$
B_{\tau_2} \overset{d}{=} X
\quad\text{and}\quad
\tau_2 \ge \tau_1 \text{ a.s.}
$$

#### Proof.

We distinguish the events $\{X = Y\}$ and $\{X \ne Y\}$.

We know:
- $Y = x_1$ on $A_1$.
- $Y = y_2 = \dfrac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}$ on $A_2 \cup A_3$.
- $X$ takes values $x_1, x_2, x_3$ with probabilities $p_1,p_2,p_3$.

We already have $\tau_1$ such that $B_{\tau_1} \overset{d}{=} Y$.

1. **On the event $\{X = Y\}$.**  
   This is exactly $A_1$, since there $X = x_1 = Y$.  
   On this event, we can set
   $$
   \tau_2 = \tau_1.
   $$
   Then $B_{\tau_2} = B_{\tau_1} = x_1$ matches $X$ on $A_1$.

2. **On the event $\{X \ne Y\}$, i.e., $A_2 \cup A_3$.**  
   On $A_2 \cup A_3$, $Y = y_2$ is some value between $x_2$ and $x_3$, and we want to further “split” $y_2$ into the values $x_2$ and $x_3$ with probabilities
   $$
   P(X = x_2 \mid A_2 \cup A_3) = \frac{p_2}{p_2 + p_3}, \qquad
   P(X = x_3 \mid A_2 \cup A_3) = \frac{p_3}{p_2 + p_3}.
   $$

   After time $\tau_1$, define the shifted process
   $$
   Z_t = B_{\tau_1 + t}, \quad t \ge 0.
   $$
   By the strong Markov property, $(Z_t - B_{\tau_1})_{t\ge0}$ is a SBM independent of $\mathcal{F}_{\tau_1}$, so $Z_t$ is a Brownian motion started at $B_{\tau_1}=Y$.

   Define
   $$
   T = \inf\{t \ge 0 : Z_t \in \{x_2, x_3\}\},
   $$
   and set
   $$
   \tau_2 = \tau_1 + T.
   $$

   Then
   $$
   B_{\tau_2} = Z_T \in \{x_2,x_3\}.
   $$

   The hitting probabilities of $x_2$ and $x_3$ by a SBM starting at $y_2$ (with $x_2 < y_2 < x_3$) are
   $$
   P(Z_T = x_3) = \frac{y_2 - x_2}{x_3 - x_2}, \qquad
   P(Z_T = x_2) = \frac{x_3 - y_2}{x_3 - x_2}.
   $$

   Now check these match the conditional probabilities:

   - Using $y_2 = \dfrac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3}$,
     $$
     y_2 - x_2 
       = \frac{x_2 p_2 + x_3 p_3}{p_2 + p_3} - x_2
       = \frac{(x_3 - x_2)p_3}{p_2 + p_3},
     $$
     therefore
     $$
     \frac{y_2 - x_2}{x_3 - x_2}
       = \frac{p_3}{p_2 + p_3}
       = P(X = x_3 \mid A_2 \cup A_3).
     $$

   - Similarly,
     $$
     x_3 - y_2
       = (x_3 - x_2) \frac{p_2}{p_2 + p_3},
     $$
     and
     $$
     \frac{x_3 - y_2}{x_3 - x_2}
       = \frac{p_2}{p_2 + p_3}
       = P(X = x_2 \mid A_2 \cup A_3).
     $$

   Thus, conditional on $Y = y_2$, $B_{\tau_2}$ has exactly the same conditional distribution as $X$ on $A_2 \cup A_3$.

Putting these pieces together, we have:

- On $A_1$, $B_{\tau_2} = x_1$ with prob. $p_1$.
- On $A_2 \cup A_3$, $B_{\tau_2}$ takes values $x_2$ and $x_3$ with conditional probabilities $p_2/(p_2+p_3)$ and $p_3/(p_2+p_3)$, hence overall probabilities $p_2$ and $p_3$.

So $B_{\tau_2}$ and $X$ have the same three-point distribution.

#### Conclusion.

The construction above yields a stopping time $\tau_2$ such that $B_{\tau_2} \overset{d}{=} X$.

---

### (c)(ii) Verifying $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$ and stopping-time property

#### Claim.  

The random time $\tau_2$ defined by  
$$
\tau_2 =
\begin{cases}
\tau_1, & \text{on } \{X = Y\} = A_1,\\[3pt]
\tau_1 + T, & \text{on } \{X \ne Y\} = A_2 \cup A_3,
\end{cases}
$$
is a stopping time with respect to $(\mathcal{F}_t)$ and satisfies $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$ a.s.

#### Proof.

1. **Inequality $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$.**  
   By construction:
   - On $A_1$, $\tau_2 = \tau_1$.
   - On $A_2 \cup A_3$, $\tau_2 = \tau_1 + T$ with $T\ge 0$.
   So always $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$.

2. **Stopping-time property.**  

   - $\tau_1$ is a stopping time by definition as a hitting time of a closed set.
   - $T$ is a hitting time for the process $Z_t = B_{\tau_1 + t}$, hence a stopping time with respect to the shifted filtration. By the strong Markov property and standard theory, $\tau_1 + T$ is then a stopping time in the original filtration.
   - Since $\tau_2$ is defined piecewise using events in $\mathcal{F}_{\tau_1}$ and stopping times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_1+T$, it is again a stopping time.

Formally, for each $t$,
$$
\{\tau_2 \le t\}
=
\big(\{X=Y\}\cap\{\tau_1\le t\}\big)
\;\cup\;
\big(\{X\ne Y\}\cap\{\tau_1+T\le t\}\big),
$$
which lies in $\mathcal{F}_t$ since both $\tau_1$ and $\tau_1+T$ are stopping times and $\{X=Y\}$, $\{X\ne Y\}$ are measurable.

#### Conclusion.

$\tau_2$ is a stopping time, and $\tau_2 \ge \tau_1$ a.s., with $B_{\tau_2}$ distributed exactly as $X$.

## Key Takeaways

- **Coarse σ-algebras compress information.**  
  Conditioning $X$ on $\mathcal{G} = \sigma\{A_1, A_2\cup A_3\}$ collapses three distinct values into a **two-point** random variable $Y$.

- **Two-point mean-zero distributions and Brownian motion.**  
  Any two-point mean-zero variable $\{a,b\}$ with $a<0<b$ can be realized as $B_\tau$ where $\tau$ is the first hitting time of $\{a,b\}$ for SBM. The probabilities are determined by the harmonic property:
  $$
  P(B_\tau = b) = \frac{|a|}{|a|+|b|}, 
  \quad 
  P(B_\tau = a) = \frac{|b|}{|a|+|b|}.
  $$

- **Strong Markov property for “multi-step” constructions.**  
  We first reach the “coarse” random value $Y$ by $\tau_1$, then, conditional on $Y$, we restart a fresh Brownian motion and run it until it hits the finer targets $x_2,x_3$. This is a standard **Skorokhod-embedding style** idea in miniature.

- **Matching conditional probabilities via hitting probabilities.**  
  The conditional mean $y_2 = E(X \mid A_2 \cup A_3)$ sits between $x_2$ and $x_3$ in such a way that Brownian hitting probabilities
  from $y_2$ to $x_2$ and $x_3$ reproduce precisely
  $$
  P(X=x_2\mid A_2\cup A_3),\quad P(X=x_3\mid A_2\cup A_3).
  $$

- **Piecewise stopping times.**  
  You can glue stopping times together along measurable events, and you can add a stopping time to another by using the strong Markov property:
  if $T$ is a stopping time for the shifted process after $\tau_1$, then $\tau_1+T$ is a stopping time for the original filtration.

This problem is a clean template for representing discrete random variables as values of Brownian motion at (carefully chosen) stopping times.
