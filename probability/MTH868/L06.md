**Topic:** Tangent Vectors, Pushforwards, Curves, Immersions, Submersions, Critical Points

## 1. Review from Last Time (Page 1)

### Smooth Manifolds
We are working with a **smooth manifold** \( M \).
- Intuition: Locally, \( M \) looks like \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
- Charts allow us to do calculus even though globally the space may be curved or weird.

---

## 2. Tangent Space via Derivations (Key Idea)

### Definition (Very Important)
The **tangent space** at a point \( p \in M \), denoted \( T_p M \), is defined as:

> The set of **derivations** at \( p \), i.e., linear maps  
> \[
> X : C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}
> \]
> satisfying the Leibniz rule:
> \[
> X(fg) = f(p)X(g) + g(p)X(f)
> \]

**Stats intuition:**  
This is an abstract way of defining a *directional derivative* without coordinates.  
Think of it as “how functions change at point \( p \) along some direction”.

---

### Coordinate Description (What Makes This Concrete)

If  
\[
(U, \phi = (x^1, \dots, x^n))
\]
is a chart around \( p \), then the vectors
\[
\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\bigg|_p \right\}_{i=1}^n
\]
form a **basis of \( T_p M \)**.

**Professor emphasis:**  
> “This is why tangent spaces are \( n \)-dimensional, not infinite-dimensional.”

**Stats parallel:**  
This is exactly the same reason gradients live in \( \mathbb{R}^n \), even though functions live in infinite-dimensional spaces.

---

## 3. Pushforward (Differential of a Map)

Let \( F : M \to N \) be smooth.

### Definition
The **pushforward** (also called the differential)
\[
F_*|_p : T_p M \to T_{F(p)} N
\]
is defined by
\[
(F_* X)(f) = X(f \circ F)
\]

**Interpretation:**  
- Vectors act on functions
- Pushforward tells you how a vector on \( M \) acts on functions on \( N \)

---

### Coordinate Formula (Jacobians Appear!)

If \( F : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \), then
\[
F_* \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right)
= \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\partial F^j}{\partial x^i}
\frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}
\]

**Professor explicitly said:**  
> “This *is* the Jacobian. Nothing mysterious is happening.”

**Stats connection:**  
This is exactly the linearization you use in:
- Delta method
- Multivariate Taylor expansions
- Sensitivity analysis

---

## 4. Chain Rule for Pushforwards (Proposition)

If
\[
M \xrightarrow{F} N \xrightarrow{G} P
\]
are smooth, then
\[
(G \circ F)_*|_p = G_*|_{F(p)} \circ F_*|_p
\]

### Proof Sketch (from lecture)
For \( X \in T_p M \):
\[
((G \circ F)_* X)(f) = X(f \circ G \circ F)
\]
and
\[
(G_* (F_* X))(f) = (F_* X)(f \circ G) = X(f \circ G \circ F)
\]

Thus they agree.

**Stats analogy:**  
Linear approximations compose exactly the way you expect.

---

## 5. Curves and Velocity Vectors (Page 2)

### Definition
A **curve** in \( M \) is a smooth map
\[
c : (a,b) \to M
\]

### Velocity Vector
The velocity at \( t_0 \) is
\[
c'(t_0) = c_* \left( \frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t_0} \right) \in T_{c(t_0)} M
\]

**Key intuition:**  
Tangent vectors *are velocities of curves*.

---

### Fundamental Proposition
Given any \( p \in M \) and any \( X \in T_p M \),  
there exists a curve \( c \) such that
\[
c(0) = p, \quad c'(0) = X
\]

**Professor emphasis:**  
> “This is why curves are not just examples, they *characterize* tangent vectors.”

---

### Proof Idea (Very Important Construction)
- Choose coordinates \( \phi(p) = 0 \)
- Write
  \[
  X = \sum a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
  \]
- Define
  \[
  c(t) = \phi^{-1}(a^1 t, \dots, a^n t)
  \]

This is the manifold version of a straight line.

---

## 6. Immersions and Submersions (Page 2–3)

Let \( F : M \to N \).

### Immersion
\( F \) is an **immersion** if
\[
F_*|_p \text{ is injective for all } p
\]

**Meaning:**  
Locally, \( M \) does not collapse dimensions.

---

### Submersion
\( F \) is a **submersion** if
\[
F_*|_p \text{ is surjective for all } p
\]

**Meaning:**  
Locally, \( F \) hits all directions in \( N \).

---

### Examples
- \( F(t) = (\cos t, \sin t) \) is an immersion
- \( F(t) = (t^2, t^3) \) is **not** an immersion at \( t=0 \)

**Why:**  
Derivative vanishes, rank drops.

---

## 7. Rank, Critical Points, Regular Values (Page 3)

### Rank
\[
\text{rank } F(p) = \dim(\text{image of } F_*|_p)
\]

---

### Critical Point
\( p \in M \) is a **critical point** if
\[
F_*|_p \text{ is not surjective}
\]

### Regular Point
Otherwise, \( p \) is a **regular point**.

---

### Regular Value
\( y \in N \) is a **regular value** if
\[
\forall p \in F^{-1}(y), \; p \text{ is a regular point}
\]

---

### Example
\[
F(x,y) = x^2 - y^2
\]

- Gradient:
  \[
  \nabla F = (2x, -2y)
  \]
- Only critical point is \( (0,0) \)
- Hence:
  - Only critical value is \( 0 \)
  - All other values are regular

**Stats analogy:**  
Critical points are where the Jacobian loses rank.  
Regular values are “well-behaved” outputs.

---

## 8. Big Picture (Professor’s Framing)

> “Everything we do from here on depends on understanding when maps behave like linear maps locally.”

- Immersions → embedded submanifolds
- Submersions → level sets are manifolds
- Regular values → preimages are smooth manifolds

This is the foundation for:
- Implicit Function Theorem
- Sard’s Theorem
- Transversality
- Differential topology
