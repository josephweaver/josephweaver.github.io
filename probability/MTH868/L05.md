## 1. Review: Lie Group Actions and Quotients

### Setup
Let $ G $ be a **Lie group**, and let $ M $ be a **smooth manifold**.
Assume $ G $ acts smoothly on $ M $:
$$
G \times M \to M, \quad (g,x) \mapsto g \cdot x
$$
where each group element acts by a diffeomorphism of $ M $.

### Orbit Space / Quotient
Define an equivalence relation on $ M $:
$$
x \sim y \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists g \in G \text{ such that } x = g \cdot y.
$$
The **quotient space** is
$$
M/G := M / \sim,
$$
the set of orbits of the action.

⚠️ Important warning:
> **In general, $ M/G $ is NOT a smooth manifold.**
Often it is not even a manifold at all.

## 2. Example: Complex Projective Space

Let
- $ G = \mathbb{C}^\* $ (nonzero complex numbers, multiplicative group),
- $ M = \mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} $,
- action: scalar multiplication
$$
\lambda \cdot (z_0,\dots,z_n) = (\lambda z_0,\dots,\lambda z_n).
$$

Then
$$
\mathbb{CP}^n = (\mathbb{C}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}) / \mathbb{C}^\*.
$$

This quotient *does* admit a smooth manifold structure, but this is special and requires work.

---

## 3. Example: A Quotient That Is NOT a Manifold

Consider:
- $ S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \cong \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{R} $,
- $ G = S^1 \subset \mathbb{C} $,
- action: rotation in the complex coordinate
$$
e^{i\theta} \cdot (z,t) = (e^{i\theta} z, t).
$$

### What does the quotient look like?
- Each orbit collapses a horizontal circle to a point.
- Only the $ t $-coordinate remains.
- The quotient is homeomorphic to the interval $[-1,1]$.

### Why is this NOT a manifold?
- At the north and south poles, the entire group fixes the point.
- The local structure near those points is singular.
- There is no neighborhood homeomorphic to an open interval.

**Key lesson**:
> Quotients by group actions typically produce spaces with singularities.
Manifold structure requires strong extra conditions.

## 4. Motivation: What Is the Tangent Space?

We now turn to §8: **Tangent Spaces**.

Goal:
> Given a smooth manifold $ M $ and a point $ p \in M $, define the tangent space $ T_pM $ *intrinsically*, without embedding $ M \subset \mathbb{R}^n $.

In Euclidean space, tangent vectors are arrows.
On manifolds, we need a coordinate-free definition.

## 5. Germs of Smooth Functions

Let $ C^\infty(M) $ be the set of smooth real-valued functions on $ M $.

Define an equivalence relation:
$$
f \sim g \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists \text{ open } U \ni p \text{ such that } f|_U = g|_U.
$$

### Definition (Germ)
The equivalence class of $ f $ at $ p $ is called the **germ of $ f $ at $ p $**.

Denote the set of all germs by:
$$
C_p^\infty(M).
$$

Intuition:
- A germ remembers *only* the behavior of a function infinitesimally near $ p $.
- Values far away from $ p $ are irrelevant.

### Algebra Structure
$ C_p^\infty(M) $ is an $ \mathbb{R} $-algebra:
- addition,
- multiplication,
- scalar multiplication
are inherited from functions.

---

## 6. Definition: Derivations

### Definition
A **derivation at $ p $** is a linear map
$$
D : C_p^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}
$$
satisfying the **Leibniz rule**:
$$
D(fg) = D(f)\,g(p) + f(p)\,D(g).
$$

This is an abstract version of differentiation.

### Definition (Tangent Space)
$$
T_pM := \{ \text{derivations at } p \}.
$$

---

## 7. Tangent Space Is a Vector Space

If $ D_1, D_2 \in T_pM $ and $ \lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, then:
- $ D_1 + D_2 $ is a derivation,
- $ \lambda D_1 $ is a derivation.

Hence $ T_pM $ is a real vector space.

---

## 8. Coordinate Description of Tangent Vectors

Let $ (U,\varphi) $ be a chart about $ p $, with:
$$
\varphi = (x^1,\dots,x^n), \quad \varphi(p)=0.
$$

For any vector $ c = (c^1,\dots,c^n) \in \mathbb{R}^n $, define:
$$
D_c(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n c^i \frac{\partial (f \circ \varphi^{-1})}{\partial x^i}(0).
$$

This is a derivation.

Thus we get a linear map:
$$
\Phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to T_pM, \quad c \mapsto D_c.
$$

---

## 9. Proposition: $ \Phi $ Is an Isomorphism

### Injectivity
If $ c \neq 0 $, then for some coordinate function $ x^i $,
$$
D_c(x^i) = c^i \neq 0,
$$
so $ D_c \neq 0 $.

### Surjectivity
Given any derivation $ D $, define:
$$
c^i := D(x^i).
$$
Using Taylor’s theorem, one shows:
$$
D = D_c.
$$

Thus:
$$
T_pM \cong \mathbb{R}^n
$$
(non-canonically, since it depends on the chart).

---

## 10. Basis of the Tangent Space

The derivations:
$$
\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\Big|_p, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\Big|_p \right\}
$$
form a basis for $ T_pM $.

Shorthand:
$$
\partial_i := \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p.
$$

---

## 11. Pushforward of Tangent Vectors

Let $ F : M \to N $ be smooth and $ X \in T_pM $.

### Definition (Pushforward)
The pushforward $ F_*X \in T_{F(p)}N $ is defined by:
$$
(F_*X)(g) := X(g \circ F),
\quad g \in C^\infty_{F(p)}(N).
$$

This defines a linear map:
$$
F_* : T_pM \to T_{F(p)}N.
$$

This generalizes the Jacobian matrix.

---

## Summary
- Quotients by group actions often fail to be manifolds.
- Tangent vectors are defined abstractly as derivations.
- Coordinates recover the familiar partial derivatives.
- Pushforwards generalize Jacobians intrinsically.
