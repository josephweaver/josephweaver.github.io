# MTH 868 – Lecture 1 Expanded Notes
*(Topology / Differential Geometry for Manifolds)*

## 0. Big Picture (Why This Course Looks Like This)

This course is building the **analytic foundations of smooth manifolds**.  
The first few weeks look like *multivariable real analysis* because:

- Manifolds are **locally Euclidean**
- Smooth structure is defined via **smooth maps between open sets of ℝⁿ**
- Everything reduces locally to statements about Jacobians, derivatives, and rank

If you understand:
- multivariable differentiation,
- inverse / implicit function theorems,
- Jacobians and rank,

then the rest of differential geometry is mostly **bookkeeping plus geometry**.

## 1. Smooth Maps Between Euclidean Spaces

### Definition: Vector-Valued Functions
A function  
$$
F : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m
$$
is written componentwise as
$$
F(x) = (F^1(x), F^2(x), \dots, F^m(x))
$$
where each $ F^i : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} $.

This viewpoint is critical because **all derivatives are taken componentwise**.

---

## 2. Jacobian and Differential

### Jacobian Matrix
At a point $ p \in \mathbb{R}^n $, the **Jacobian** of $ F $ is the matrix
$$
JF(p) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^1}{\partial x^n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial F^m}{\partial x^n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Differential
The **differential**
$$
DF_p : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m
$$
is the linear map represented by $ JF(p) $.

> Interpretation:  
> $ DF_p $ is the **best linear approximation** to $ F $ at $ p $.

In probability/statistics terms:
- Think *first-order Taylor expansion*
- Everything geometric later depends on this linearization

---

## 3. Smoothness (Cⁿ and C^∞)

### Multi-Index Notation
A multi-index $ \alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) $ has order
$$
\|\alpha\| = \alpha_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n
$$

Mixed partial derivative:
$$
\partial^\alpha F^i
= \frac{\partial^{\|\alpha\|} F^i}
{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}}
$$

### Definition: Smooth (C^∞)
A function $ F $ is **smooth** if all partial derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous.

> Smoothness is the default regularity class for manifolds in this course.

## 4. Local Diffeomorphisms

### Definition
Let $ U \subset \mathbb{R}^n $ be open.  
A smooth map $ F : U \to \mathbb{R}^n $ is a **local diffeomorphism at $ x \in U $** if:

- There exist neighborhoods $ V \ni x $, $ W \ni F(x) $
- $ F\|_V : V \to W $ is bijective
- The inverse $ F^{-1} : W \to V $ is smooth

This is a *local* notion, not global.

---

## 5. Inverse Function Theorem (IFT)

### Statement
Let $ U \subset \mathbb{R}^n $ be open and  
$ F : U \to \mathbb{R}^n $ be $ C^\infty $.

If
$$
\det(JF(x)) \neq 0
$$
then $ F $ is a **local diffeomorphism at $ x $**.

### Interpretation
- Nonzero determinant = derivative is invertible
- Locally, $ F $ behaves like a linear isomorphism
- Geometry near $ x $ is preserved (up to smooth distortion)

---

## 6. Important Examples (Why Determinant ≠ 0 Matters)

### Example 1: $ f(x) = x^3 $
- Smooth and bijective on ℝ
- $ f'(0) = 0 $
- Not a local diffeomorphism at 0
- Inverse derivative blows up

**Lesson:** Global bijection does NOT imply local diffeomorphism.

---

### Example 2: $ g(z) = z^2 $ on $ \mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2 $
- Smooth
- Jacobian determinant = 0 at $ z = 0 $
- Not injective (many square roots)

**Lesson:** Rank failure kills invertibility.

---

## 7. Implicit Function Theorem (IFT – Geometric Version)

### Setup
Let
$$
F : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^m
$$
and suppose
$$
F(x_0, y_0) = 0
$$

We want to solve:
$$
F(x, y) = 0
$$

### Intuition
- Expect an $ n $-dimensional solution set
- Want to write solutions as $ y = h(x) $

---

### Statement
If
$$
\det\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0) \right) \neq 0
$$
then:

- There exist neighborhoods $ A \ni x_0 $, $ B \ni y_0 $
- There exists a **unique smooth function** $ h : A \to B $
- Such that
$$
F(x, h(x)) = 0
$$

---

## 8. Example: Circle as an Implicit Curve

Let
$$
F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1
$$

- Zero set = unit circle
- Near points where $ y \neq 0 $, solve for $ y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} $
- Near points where $ x \neq 0 $, solve for $ x $ instead

**Key Insight:**  
Manifolds are often **not global graphs**, but always **local graphs**.

---

## 9. Manifolds (Chapter 2 Start)

### Motivation
A manifold is a space that:
- Looks like ℝⁿ **locally**
- May be curved or topologically nontrivial **globally**

---

### Definition: Smooth n-Manifold
A topological space $ M $ is a **smooth n-dimensional manifold** if:

#### (1) Topological Conditions
- Hausdorff
- Second countable

(Technical conditions ensuring good behavior of limits, partitions of unity, etc.)

---

#### (2) Locally Euclidean
For every $ p \in M $, there exists:
- An open set $ U \subset M $
- A homeomorphism (chart)
$$
\varphi : U \to \varphi(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$

This means locally:
$$
M \approx \mathbb{R}^n
$$

---

#### (3) Smooth Compatibility
If $ (U, \varphi) $ and $ (V, \psi) $ are charts with overlap:

$$
\psi \circ \varphi^{-1} : \varphi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)
$$

must be **smooth**.

These are called **transition maps**.

## 10. Why This Matters for You (Stats Perspective)

- Tangent spaces = derivatives on manifolds
- Parameter spaces in statistics are manifolds
- Constraints define manifolds via implicit function theorem
- Fisher information is a Riemannian metric
- Optimization on manifolds uses these tools directly

---

## 11. What You Should Review (Minimal Survival Kit)

If you are missing prerequisites, focus ONLY on:
- Multivariable derivatives and Jacobians
- Inverse Function Theorem
- Implicit Function Theorem
- Linear algebra: rank, determinant, invertibility

You **do not** need:
- Abstract algebra
- Algebraic topology (yet)
- Homology theory (yet)
