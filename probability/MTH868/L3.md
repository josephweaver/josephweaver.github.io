## 1. Chain Rule in Several Variables

Let  
- $ f : U \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n $  
- $ g : V \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^\ell $  

Assume:
- $ f(U) \subset V $
- $ f $ and $ g $ are smooth ($ C^\infty $)

Then the Jacobian of the composition satisfies:

$$
J(g \circ f)(x) = Jg(f(x)) \cdot Jf(x)
$$

More explicitly, the $ (i,j) $-entry is:
$$
\frac{\partial (g \circ f)^i}{\partial x^j}
= \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial g^i}{\partial y^k}(f(x))
  \frac{\partial f^k}{\partial x^j}(x)
$$

**Key idea:**  
The multivariable chain rule is just **matrix multiplication of Jacobians**.

## 2. Smooth Manifolds (Reminder)

> “Let $ M $ be a manifold”

This means:
- $ M $ is a **topological manifold**
- Equipped with a **smooth structure**

Formally:
A smooth $ n $-manifold $ M $ is a topological space with a **maximal smooth atlas**
$$
\{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in A}
$$
where:
- $ U_\alpha \subset M $ are open
- $ \varphi_\alpha : U_\alpha \to \mathbb{R}^n $ are homeomorphisms
- All transition maps  
  $$
  \varphi_\beta \circ \varphi_\alpha^{-1}
  $$
  are smooth where defined

---

## 3. Smooth Maps Between Manifolds

### Definition
Let:
- $ M $ be an $ m $-manifold with charts $ (U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha) $
- $ N $ be an $ n $-manifold with charts $ (V_\beta, \psi_\beta) $

A map $ F : M \to N $ is **smooth** ($ C^\infty $) if:

For every $ p \in M $,  
there exist charts $ U_\alpha \ni p $, $ V_\beta \ni F(p) $ such that:

$$
\psi_\beta \circ F \circ \varphi_\alpha^{-1}
: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n
$$
is smooth as a map of Euclidean spaces.

### Important Remark
This definition is **independent of the choice of charts**.

Why?
Because changing charts composes with smooth transition maps.

---

## 4. Diffeomorphisms

### Definition
A smooth map $ F : M \to N $ is a **diffeomorphism** if:
- $ F $ is bijective
- $ F $ is smooth
- $ F^{-1} $ is smooth

---

## 5. Charts are Local Diffeomorphisms

Let $ (U, \varphi) $ be a chart on a manifold $ M $.

Then:
$$
\varphi : U \to \varphi(U) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$
is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

Why?
- $ \varphi $ is a homeomorphism
- Transition maps guarantee smoothness
- Identity maps are smooth

**Identity map:**  
$$
\text{id}(x) = x
$$

## 6. Example: Torus Map

Recall:
$$
T^2 = S^1 \times S^1
$$

Define:
$$
F(e^{i\theta_1}, e^{i\theta_2})
= (e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}, e^{i\theta_2})
$$

Then:
- $ F $ is smooth
- Inverse is:
$$
F^{-1}(e^{i\phi_1}, e^{i\phi_2})
= (e^{i(\phi_1 - \phi_2)}, e^{i\phi_2})
$$

Hence:
$$
F : T^2 \to T^2 \text{ is a diffeomorphism}
$$

Geometrically: this is a **shear** on the torus.

---

## 7. Diffeomorphisms of $ \mathbb{R} $

Example:
$$
f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}
$$

A bijection with smooth inverse is a diffeomorphism.

Fact:
Any **strictly monotone** smooth function with $ f'(x) \neq 0 $ everywhere
is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

Counterexample:
$$
x \mapsto x^3
$$
is bijective but inverse is not smooth at 0.

---

## 8. The Diffeomorphism Group

Define:
$$
\mathrm{Diff}(M) = \{ F : M \to M \mid F \text{ is a diffeomorphism} \}
$$

Then:
- Closed under composition
- Inverses exist
- Identity exists

So $ \mathrm{Diff}(M) $ is a **group**.

---

## 9. Induced Smooth Structures (Important Subtlety)

Let $ Q \subset \mathbb{R}^2 $ be the **unit circle**.

We know:
$$
S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2
$$

But:
- $ S^1 $ does **not** inherit a smooth structure by restricting charts of $ \mathbb{R}^2 $

Instead:
- We give $ S^1 $ a smooth structure using **charts modeled on $ \mathbb{R} $**

Key point:
There is **no diffeomorphism**:
$$
\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2
$$
onto a neighborhood of a corner or boundary.

This is why manifolds have a **fixed dimension**.

## 10. Smooth Structures up to Diffeomorphism

Being diffeomorphic is an **equivalence relation** on smooth manifolds.

A *diffeomorphism class* = one smooth structure up to smooth change of coordinates.

Facts:
- $ \mathbb{R}^n $ has a unique smooth structure
- $ S^1 $ has a unique smooth structure
- **But:** for $ S^7 \subset \mathbb{R}^8 $, there are **multiple** smooth structures  
  (Milnor’s exotic spheres)

---

## 11. Lie Groups

### Definition
A **Lie group** is:
- A smooth manifold $ M $
- Equipped with a group structure
- Such that:
  - Multiplication $ M \times M \to M $ is smooth
  - Inversion $ M \to M $ is smooth

---

## 12. Example: $ \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R}) $

$$
\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})
= \{ A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : \det A \neq 0 \}
$$

Facts:
- Open subset of $ \mathbb{R}^{n^2} $
- Matrix multiplication is polynomial → smooth
- Inverse map:
$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \cdot \text{adj}(A)
$$
is smooth where $ \det A \neq 0 $

Conclusion:
$$
\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{R}) \text{ is a Lie group}
$$

## Mental Map (Big Picture)

- Charts let you reduce manifold problems to Euclidean calculus
- Smoothness is defined **via charts**
- Diffeomorphisms are the “isomorphisms” of smooth manifolds
- Lie groups marry algebra + smooth geometry
