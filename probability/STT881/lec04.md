# 4 — Outer Measure, Measurable Sets, Cantor Set, Non-Measurable Sets, σ-Finite Measures, Integration

Lecture 4 concludes the foundational measure theory part:

Outer measure and measurable sets

Cantor set and non-measurable sets

Borel vs Lebesgue σ-algebras

σ-finite measures

Beginning the theory of integration via simple functions

We assume we already have:
- A set $\Omega$,
- An algebra $\mathcal{A}$,
- A premeasure $\mu$ defined on $\mathcal{A}$.

Goal: Extend $\mu$ to a measure on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ by using **outer measure** and **Carathéodory measurability**.

# 1. Outer Measure

Given $A \subseteq \Omega$,
$$
\mu^*(A)
  = \inf \left\{
      \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_i)
      : A \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i,\; A_i \in \mathcal{A}
    \right\}.
$$

Properties:

1. **Subadditivity**  
   $$
   \mu^*\!\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i\right)
       \le \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu^*(B_i).
   $$

2. **Monotonicity**  
   If $B \subseteq D$, then  
   $$
   \mu^*(B) \le \mu^*(D).
   $$

---

# 2. Carathéodory Measurability

A set $E \subseteq \Omega$ is **measurable** if:
$$
\mu^*(F)
= \mu^*(F \cap E)
+ \mu^*(F \cap E^c)
\quad\forall F \subseteq \Omega.
$$

Intuition (page 1 diagram):  
A measurable set is one for which every set $F$ can be **cleanly partitioned** into “inside $E$” and “outside $E$” without losing measure.

## Zero-measure sets are measurable

**Claim:**  
If $\mu^*(E)=0$, then $E$ is measurable, and so is every subset of $E$.

Proof sketch:

- $F \cap E \subseteq E$, hence  
  $$
  0 \le \mu^*(F \cap E) \le \mu^*(E)=0.
  $$
- Then  
  $$
  \mu^*(F)
  = \mu^*(F \cap E) + \mu^*(F \cap E^c).
  $$

Thus all subsets of null sets are measurable.

# 3. σ-Algebra Generated and Lebesgue Measurability

Given the algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of finite unions of intervals $(a_i,b_i]$, we know:

$$
\sigma(\mathcal{A})
  = \text{Borel σ-algebra } \mathcal{B}.
$$

Carathéodory produces:
- A larger σ-algebra $\mathcal{A}^*$ of all Lebesgue measurable sets,
- With $\mathcal{B} \subsetneq \mathcal{A}^*$.

---

# 4. Cantor Set (continued)

Let $F_n$ be the standard Cantor construction:
- Remove the open middle third at each step,
- $F = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty F_n$.

### Measure of Cantor set
$$
\mu(F) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n = 0.
$$

### Cardinality of Cantor set
Using ternary expansions:
$$
F = \left\{
      \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{\delta_i}{3^i} : \delta_i \in \{0,2\}
    \right\},
$$
which is in bijection with binary expansions of $[0,1]$.  
Thus:
- $\text{card}(F) = \text{card}(\mathbb{R})$,
- But there are $2^{\text{card}(F)}$ subsets of $F$, which is **strictly larger** than $\mathbb{R}$.

**Conclusion:**  
Most subsets of the Cantor set are *not* Lebesgue measurable.  
The Lebesgue σ-algebra is too small to contain them.

---

# 5. Borel σ-Algebra vs Lebesgue σ-Algebra

- Borel σ-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ = σ-algebra generated by open sets.
- Lebesgue σ-algebra $\mathcal{A}^*$ includes **all** Borel sets plus **all subsets of Lebesgue null sets**.

Thus:
$$
\mathcal{B} \subsetneq \mathcal{A}^*.
$$

Borel sets have “nicely definable structure,” but Lebesgue sets allow measurability of far more pathological sets.

# 6. Existence of Non-Measurable Sets (using Axiom of Choice)

The lecture constructs (page 1–2) a **Vitali set** inside $[0,1]$:

Consider equivalence relation:
$$
x \sim y \iff x - y \in \mathbb{Q}.
$$

Pick exactly **one representative from each equivalence class**.  
Call the set $B$.

Then:

- The sets $B + q$ (shifts by rational numbers) are disjoint or nearly so.
-  
  $$
  \bigcup_{q \in \mathbb{Q} \cap [-1,1]} (B + q)
    \supseteq [0,1]
    \subseteq [-1,2].
  $$

- If $B$ were measurable and translation-invariant, we would get contradictions such as  
  $$
  \mu([0,1]) = \sum_{q} \mu(B), \qquad \mu([-1,2]) = 3.
  $$

Therefore:

**Conclusion:** Vitali sets are *not* Lebesgue measurable.

# 7. σ-Finite Measures

A measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is **σ-finite** if:

$$
\exists E_n \uparrow \Omega \quad \text{such that } \mu(E_n) < \infty.
$$

Example:
$$
\lambda([-n,n]) = 2n < \infty,
\quad
\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty [-n,n] = \mathbb{R}.
$$

Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ is σ-finite even though $\lambda(\mathbb{R}) = \infty$.

σ-finiteness is essential for defining integration properly.

# 8. Measurable Functions

Given $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$:

A function $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is **$\mathcal{F}$-$\mathcal{B}$ measurable** if:
$$
f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{F}, \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{B}.
$$

This is how random variables will be defined once probability is added.

---

# 9. Integration of Simple Functions

Start with a **simple function**:
$$
\varphi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \mathbf{1}_{A_i},
$$
where:
- $A_i$ are measurable,
- $A_i$ are disjoint,
- $\mu(A_i)<\infty$.

Define the integral:
$$
\int_\Omega \varphi \, d\mu
  = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \mu(A_i).
$$

---

# 10. Properties of Integration (for simple functions)

Let $\varphi,\psi$ be simple functions, $a\in\mathbb{R}$:

1. **Non-negativity**:  
   If $\varphi \ge 0$, then $\int \varphi\, d\mu \ge 0$.

2. **Homogeneity**:  
   $$
   \int a\varphi\, d\mu = a \int \varphi\, d\mu.
   $$

3. **Additivity**:  
   $$
   \int (\varphi + \psi)\, d\mu
   = \int \varphi\, d\mu + \int \psi\, d\mu.
   $$

These are the algebraic foundations for Lebesgue integration.
