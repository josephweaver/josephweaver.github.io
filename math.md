## ∧ / ∨ Minimum & Maximum Mnemonic

In analysis and probability:

\[
a \wedge b = \min(a,b), \qquad a \vee b = \max(a,b)
\]

A visual mnemonic:

- **∨ = max** — looks like a **down-arrow** ↓ landing on the **highest** point  
  *arrow comes down from above → stops at the top → max*

- **∧ = min** — looks like an **up-arrow** ↑ rising to the **lowest** point  
  *arrow rises from below → stops at the bottom → min*
