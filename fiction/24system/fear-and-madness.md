## Fear Track (24-System)

Fear represents acute stress, dread, and cognitive overload.  
It is **situational and temporary**, but repeated extreme fear leaves lasting scars.

Fear is tracked in **levels from 0 to 6**.

Fear usually rises from:
- Witnessing overwhelming horror
- Being hunted, cornered, or helpless
- Near-death experiences
- Supernatural or existential violations

Fear usually falls through:
- Distance from the threat
- Shelter or safety
- Time, rest, reassurance
- Successful escape or containment

---

### Fear Levels

### Fear 0 — Steady
You are calm, focused, and in control.

- No mechanical effects
- Full access to all RLHF components

---

### Fear 1 — Unease
Something is wrong. You feel alert, but not panicked.

**Effects:**
- +1 Initiative when surprised or ambushed (hypervigilance)
- No penalties

**Narrative cues:**
- Restlessness
- Scanning exits
- Quiet tension

---

### Fear 2 — Tension
The threat feels real and close.

**Effects:**
- Disadvantage on reckless or impulsive actions
- Advantage on preparation, observation, and warding

**Narrative cues:**
- Short replies
- Tight grip on gear
- Growing urgency

---

### Fear 3 — Strain
Your body begins prioritizing survival over intent.

**Effects:**
- Hesitation when **advancing toward danger**
- Hesitation does not apply when retreating or bracing

**Narrative cues:**
- Pauses before acting
- Arguments to delay or withdraw
- Fixation on escape routes

---

### Fear 4 — Panic
Cognitive load overwhelms fine control.

**Effects:**
- Hesitation applies to **all hostile engagement**
- First aggressive action each scene loses one RLHF component
- Defensive and evasive actions are unaffected

**Narrative cues:**
- Shaking hands
- Tunnel vision
- Breathing control issues

---

### Fear 5 — Overwhelm
The body begins to shut down nonessential functions.

**Effects:**
- You may only use **3 of 4 RLHF components each turn**
- GM may restrict especially reckless choices
- Cannot initiate complex or coordinated plans under pressure

**Narrative cues:**
- Freezing
- Automatic reactions
- Reliance on others’ direction

---

### Fear 6 — Breakdown
Your system fails to cope.

**Effects:**
- Immediate loss of consciousness **or**
- Total withdrawal (curl, flee blindly, collapse), GM adjudicates
- If caused by supernatural or lethal horror, this may create a **lasting Bane or Survivor Resonance**

**Narrative cues:**
- Blackout
- Dissociation
- Complete surrender to instinct

---

## Fear Recovery

Fear is not permanent.

Fear may be reduced by:
- Leaving the danger zone
- Reaching shelter or safety
- Time without threat
- Reassurance from allies
- Clear evidence the threat is gone

Typical recovery:
- −1 Fear level per scene of safety
- Faster recovery with preparation, control, or success

---

## Fear and Madness

Fear is temporary.  
Madness is cumulative.

Fear causes **Hesitation**.  
Madness emerges when Banes accumulate and Hesitation becomes frequent.

Fear asks:
> “What do you do right now?”

Madness answers:
> “What can you no longer make yourself do?”

---

## Design Notes

- Fear penalizes **entering danger**, not survival
- Fear rewards caution, preparation, and withdrawal
- Fear never removes agency outright
- Madness emerges naturally if characters survive too long

Fear is the pressure.  
Madness is the shape left behind.



## Emergent Madness: A Design Note

This system does not include a traditional “madness meter.”

Instead, **madness emerges naturally from accumulated survival scars**.

### Core Principle

Madness is not the loss of control.  
Madness is the **loss of authorship**.

A character is not insane when they act randomly or irrationally.  
A character becomes mad when **the world increasingly decides for them**.

---

### How Madness Emerges

Each near-death encounter may leave behind a **Bane**:
- Hesitation in specific situations
- Loss of access to one RLHF component at critical moments
- Automatic caution, withdrawal, or fixation

Each Bane is:
- Contextual, not global
- Earned through survival
- Tied to a specific horror or lethal force

Over time, these Banes accumulate.

No single scar removes agency.  
But together, they **narrow the space of viable choices**.

The character still chooses, but fewer choices remain available.

---

### Fear vs. Madness

- **Fear** is acute and situational  
  It biases behavior in the moment.

- **Madness** is cumulative and structural  
  It is the long-term consequence of repeatedly surviving what should not be survived.

Fear asks: *“What do you do right now?”*  
Madness answers: *“What can you no longer bring yourself to do?”*

---

### The Shift in Causality

Early in a campaign:
- The player acts
- The world responds

Late in a campaign:
- The world threatens
- The player responds

No switch is flipped.  
No condition is declared.

The order of causality quietly reverses.

---

### Why This Matters

- Player agency is never removed outright
- Madness feels inevitable, not punitive
- Veterans survive longer, but act with increasing restraint
- Caution replaces initiative
- Reaction replaces intention

Madness is not imposed by a table or a roll.

**Madness is what remains when survival becomes the only reliable action.**

---

### Design Summary

- Madness is emergent, not tracked
- Survival teaches lessons that cannot be unlearned
- The world gains veto power one narrow context at a time
- Those who survive the longest are the most constrained

Not because they are weak.

Because they have learned too much.
