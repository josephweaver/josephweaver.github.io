## Atrocitas Sine Auctore  
*(“Atrocity Without an Author”)*  
*Commonly abbreviated: **Atrocitas***

### Overview

Atrocitas Sine Auctore is not a deity in the traditional sense. It possesses no will, no intent, and no independent agency. It is the name given to a real and stable structure that exists within the **cognitive realm**—the shared space of meanings, beliefs, narratives, and justifications produced through communication among minds.

Atrocitas does not act.  
It **emerges**.

---

### Ontological Status

Atrocitas exists as a **limit object** of collective cognition.

It is not an idea held by any one individual, but a persistent configuration that arises when:
- many minds interact,
- agreement replaces inquiry,
- and meaning is validated through consensus rather than examination.

Once formed, Atrocitas persists independently of any single participant. It can be weakened locally, disrupted temporarily, or avoided under specific conditions, but it cannot be destroyed so long as the conditions for its emergence remain possible.

---

### The Atrocity Convergence Theorem (Informal Statement)

Let a sequence of collective cognitive states arise through discourse among agents.

If, over time:
- questioning tends toward zero,
- dissent is suppressed or discouraged,
- and agreement is treated as proof,

then this sequence converges in the cognitive realm.

The limit of this convergence exists.

That limit is **Atrocitas**.

---

### Interpretation

Atrocitas is not the cause of atrocities.  
It is what atrocities become once responsibility is diffused beyond attribution.

It has:
- no thoughts except those thought collectively,
- no hands except those that act in agreement,
- no voice except that of unquestioned consensus.

To name Atrocitas is not to externalize blame, but to describe the shape that harm takes when no one claims authorship.

---

### Ethical Clarification

The existence of Atrocitas does not absolve individuals or groups of responsibility.

On the contrary, it describes the condition under which responsibility is most easily abandoned.

That Atrocitas emerges inevitably under certain conditions does not render those conditions harmless. Gravity is inevitable; falling remains fatal.

---

### Weakening Conditions

Atrocitas does not form, or fails to stabilize, when:
- questioning persists,
- dissent is tolerated or protected,
- conclusions remain provisional,
- or agreement is treated as hypothesis rather than truth.

In mathematical terms, sustained questioning prevents convergence.  
The limit fails to exist.

---

### Historical Note (Fictional)

Fragments of the Atrocity Convergence appear independently in several unpublished mathematical and philosophical manuscripts dating from the late 19th to early 20th century. None present a complete proof. All abandon the work shortly after establishing the existence of a non-trivial limit in the shared cognitive realm.

Later scholars would note that this pattern of independent, incomplete discovery mirrors other foundational results, suggesting that Atrocitas was not invented, but encountered.

---

### Summary

Atrocitas Sine Auctore is atrocity without authorship, harm without ownership, certainty without understanding.

It thinks through our thoughts.  
It acts by our hands.  
It grows stronger in every unquestioned conversation.

Atrocitas is what emerges when shared understanding is mistaken for shared certainty.
