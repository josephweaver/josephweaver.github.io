## Training & Advancement

In the 24-System, characters do not gain levels or experience points.
They grow through **declared intent, lived experience, and consequence**.

Advancement is tied to **story arcs**, downtime, and meaningful survival, not to combat counts or numerical accumulation.

---

### Story Arcs

A **story arc** is a complete narrative unit, such as:
- clearing or escaping a major location,
- surviving a dangerous journey,
- resolving a faction conflict,
- completing a long-term objective,
- or a period of focused downtime and training.

Advancement checks occur **only at the end of a story arc**.

---

### Training Declaration

At the start of a story arc, each character may declare **one** of the following:

- **Train a Trait**  
  Declare one trait you are actively working toward.

**OR**

- **Improve a Skill**  
  Declare one skill you are focusing on improving.

This declaration represents intent and direction.
It has **no immediate mechanical effect**.

---

### Skill Advancement

If a character completes a story arc without abandoning their training, they may increase the declared skill by **one tier**, subject to the **Skill Pyramid rule**.

#### Skill Pyramid Rule

A character may only advance a skill if they have **at least one other skill at the tier below it**.

Example:
- To raise a skill to Tier 3, the character must already have at least one other skill at Tier 2.

This prevents extreme specialization and represents the need for supporting competence.

A character may only gain **one skill increase per story arc**.

---

### Trait Acquisition

Traits are **earned**, not automatically granted.

If a character completes a story arc while actively training a trait, and the training was meaningfully represented in play, they gain that trait.

Training may include:
- in-world instruction or mentorship,
- repeated exposure to relevant danger,
- sustained behavior aligned with the trait,
- or narrative consequences that reinforce it.

The Guide should not require performance or acting; **intent and engagement are sufficient**.

A character may only gain **one new trait per story arc**.

---

### Interrupted or Failed Training

Training may be interrupted or invalidated if:
- the character abandons the declared goal,
- circumstances make the training impossible,
- or a major injury or complication fundamentally changes the outcome.

When this happens, the Guide may:
- allow the player to re-declare training,
- delay advancement until the next arc,
- or award a **different trait** that reflects what actually occurred.

Failure is still progression.

---

### Guide Guidance

When a player declares training, the Guide should:
- look for **at least one moment per session** where that training is tested, reinforced, or complicated,
- incorporate the declaration into obstacles, consequences, or opportunities,
- and let the world respond honestly to the character’s intent.

Training is not a promise of success.
It is a declaration of who the character is trying to become.

---

### Design Note

Advancement in the 24-System is not about becoming safer or stronger.
It is about becoming **more defined**.

Characters grow through commitment, scars, reputation, and survival.
