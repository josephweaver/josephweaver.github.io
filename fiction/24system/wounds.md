## Wounds, Trauma, and Disability (24-System)

Wounds represent lasting physical trauma. Unlike stamina, wounds do not recover quickly and have escalating consequences. Wounds are tracked by body region and progress through defined states.

### Wound States

All body regions follow the same basic wound ladder:

**OK → Injured → Disabled → Missing**

Each additional wound to the same region advances it one step along this ladder.

## Body Regions & Wound Tracks

### Arms (Left / Right)

Each arm tracks wounds independently.

| Wounds | State | Effect |
|------|------|-------|
| 0 | OK | Full use |
| 1 | Injured | Pain, impaired fine control |
| 2 | Disabled | Arm unusable for attacks, blocking, warding, or two-handed actions |
| 3 | Missing | Arm destroyed or severed |

Notes:
- If either arm is Disabled, two-handed weapons cannot be used.
- A second Disabled arm leaves the character effectively unarmed.

---

### Head (Special Case)

The head has unique consequences.

| Wounds | State | Effect |
|------|------|-------|
| 0 | OK | No effect |
| 1 | Injured | Stunned, disoriented, fear spike |
| 2 | Sensory Damage | Blindness, deafness, or severe impairment (GM chooses) |
| 3 | Unconscious | Immediate loss of consciousness |

Notes:
- Head wounds are never instantly fatal by default.
- Further head trauma after unconsciousness causes Core damage.

---

### Legs (Shared Track)

Legs use a shared wound pool representing both legs together.

| Wounds | State | Effect |
|------|------|-------|
| 0 | OK | Normal movement |
| 1–2 | Injured | Reduced speed, harder dodges |
| 3–4 | Disabled | Cannot run, dodge, or stand unaided |
| 5–6 | Missing | One or both legs destroyed |

Notes:
- Disabled legs reduce the character to crawling or immobility.
- Missing legs usually cause severe bleeding (see Core Wounds).

---

### Core (Torso / Vital Mass)

The core represents vital organs and systemic trauma.

| Core Wounds | Condition |
|------------|----------|
| 0–2 | Wounded |
| 3–4 | Failing |
| 5 | Dying |
| 6 | Dead |

Notes:
- Core wounds may come from direct hits, spillover, bleeding, or massive trauma.
- Reaching 6 Core wounds results in death.

## Armor and Wounds

Armor is worn as a **single unit**, not by location.

Armor converts wounds to stamina loss when hit.

| Armor Type | Wounds Converted per Hit |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Light | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Heavy | 3 |

Rules:
- Armor converts wounds **before** they are applied to a body region.
- Excess wounds beyond the armor’s conversion capacity are suffered as normal wounds.
- Armor does not prevent disabling or missing limbs once its capacity is exceeded.
- Armor may lose integrity or effectiveness based on attack results (Partial Crits, Legendary results, Breaker weapons, etc.).

## Medical Care & Recovery

- **Injured**: Can recover with rest and basic medical attention.
- **Disabled**: Requires significant treatment, splinting, or surgery.
- **Missing**: Permanent without extraordinary intervention.
- **Core wounds**: Require urgent care; failure to stabilize may result in death.

The Guide determines recovery time and consequences based on fiction, resources, and severity.
