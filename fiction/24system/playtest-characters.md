## Core Combat Loop

1. **Warding is automatic** if you are aware and not committing H.
2. **Movement & Advances** may be contested by warding.
3. **Attacks commit H** and end warding.
4. **Defense is reactive** (choose one per attack).
5. Resolve results → apply wounds, stamina, or consequences.

## RHLF Action Anchors

| Anchor | Represents |
|------|------------|
| **L** | Primary Hand (weapon use) |
| **R** | Secondary Hand (shield, support) |
| **H** | Head (attention, targeting) |
| **F** | Feet (movement, balance) |

If an anchor is injured, actions using it degrade.  
If disabled, those actions may be unavailable.

---

## Range States

- **Separated** – No contact, ranged and reach dominate
- **Melee** – Weapon-length engagement
- **Grappling** – Bodies entangled, limb control

Range is categorical, not measured.

---

## Warding & Advances

### Warding
- Automatic while aware and not engaged
- Directional, limited to one approach
- Ends when you commit **H**

### Advance (F)
- Move closer to an enemy
- Contested if the enemy is warding
- Failure: stop or push through (take consequence)
- Critical Failure: both

### Multiple Warders
- Base difficulty set by first warder
- Each additional warder: **+2 DC**
- Only one warder resolves the consequence

## Common Combat Actions

| Action | Anchors | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Attack | L | Ends warding |
| Focused Attack | L + H | Precision, control |
| Full Martial Attack | L (R) H F | Maximum commitment |
| Advance | F | Close distance |
| Move | F | Reposition safely |
| Covering Fire | L + H | Forces choices, no damage |

---

## Defense (Reactive)

Choose **one** per incoming attack:

| Defense | Anchor | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Dodge | F | Avoid attack |
| Parry | L | Redirect (weapon risk) |
| Block | R | Absorb (shield risk) |

---

## Leverage & Pressure

### Leverage (Good Circumstances)

| Leverage | Bonus Die |
|---------|-----------|
| 1 | d4 |
| 2 | d6 |
| 3 | d8 |
| 4 | d10 |
| 5 | d12 |

### Pressure (Danger)
- Raises DC
- Does not remove dice

---

## Damage, Armor, and Injury

- **Wounds** are lasting injuries
- **Stamina** is short-term shock
- Armor may convert wounds to stamina
- Negative stamina degrades actions

Injuries affect:
- movement (legs),
- attacks (arms),
- awareness (head).

---

## Fear Effects (Quick)

| Fear | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| 1–2 | Alert, cautious |
| 3 | Hesitation advancing |
| 4 | First hostile action loses 1 anchor |
| 5 | Limited to 3 anchors |
| 6 | Breakdown / withdrawal |

Fear penalizes entering danger, not survival.

---

## Weapon Notes

- **One-Handed:** 1 wound
- **Two-Handed:** 2 wounds
- **Precision:** stamina bleed
- **Chopping:** armor damage
- **Crushing:** ignores mitigation
- **Reach:** wards advances
- **Firearms:** escalation, loud, decisive on crits

---

## Covering Fire (Refined)

- Requires: **L + H**
- No damage
- Target must choose:
  - lose warding, or

---

## Table Rules

- Declare intent first.
- Fiction > geometry.
- Resolve fast and move on.
- Retreat is success.
