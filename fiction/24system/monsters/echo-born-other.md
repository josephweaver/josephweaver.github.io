## The Echo-Born Other  
*(Atrocital Projection, Consensus Manifest)*

> *The Echo-Born has no answer to the question of what it is.  
> It only reflects what is said of it, once enough voices agree.*

### Description

The Echo-Born Other is a creature of shifting, indeterminate form. Looking directly at it conveys only ambient otherness, never a stable shape. It is like trying to remember a dream after waking, the certainty that something was there without the ability to say what.

At best, observers describe a silhouette of vaguely human proportions, draped in a multitude of conflicting textiles: coats layered over robes, uniforms over rags, ceremonial garments tangled with workwear. These layers obscure features that do not truly exist. No face can be recalled. No detail holds.

Despite this indistinction, witnesses consistently insist on one detail.

When more than one Echo-Born is seen, observers agree they all look exactly the same.

---

### Nature and Origin

The Echo-Born Other is not a living organism, spirit, or summoned entity. It is a **non-living cognitive construct**, a physical resonance of **Atrocitas Sine Auctore** formed when collective belief converges without questioning.

It does not arrive.  
It is completed.

The Echo-Born emerges when:
- a community agrees on a fear,
- assigns that fear an external target,
- and treats agreement as proof.

The creature exists only so long as this consensus remains intact.

---

### Ecology

The Echo-Born has no metabolism, reproduction, or independent persistence.

It is sustained by:
- repetition of rumor,
- public accusation,
- unanimous judgment,
- symbolic punishment.

It weakens when:
- descriptions diverge,
- explanations multiply,
- or questioning becomes unavoidable.

When consensus collapses, the Echo-Born unravels without trace, leaving behind confusion, denial, and conflicting memories.

---

### Behavior

The Echo-Born behaves **exactly as the community expects it to behave**.

It does not decide its actions.  
Its actions are *pre-determined* by communal agreement.

Common agreed-upon behaviors include:
- “The Other wants to hurt us.”
- “The Other is always here, just out of sight.”
- “The Other turns our people in one of them.”
- “The Other come for the weak-willed amoung us.”

Once a behavior is widely accepted, the Echo-Born will enact it without deviation.

It is drawn to:
- public meetings,
- speeches,
- trials,
- executions,
- moments of declared certainty.

It avoids:
- unresolved arguments,
- private disagreements,
- spaces where no single narrative dominates.

---

### Combat Behavior

In conflict, the Echo-Born:
- targets dissenters first,
- targets those labeled as “outsiders” second,
- ignores those who fully conform.

It does not pursue tactics beyond what the consensus allows.  
It cannot improvise.

## Echo-Born Other — 24-System Stat Block

**Type:** Non-Living Atrocital Construct  
**Threat Level:** Variable (Consensus-Dependent)

### Hit Locations
- **R (Right Arm)**: 2
- **L (Left Arm)**: 2
- **H (Head)**: 2
- **F (Feet)**: 3
- **Core**: 6

Since, consensus is that the Echo-born is human-like, it can be wounded similiar to a human except at Head: 0 or Core: 0, the create disapates only to reform 24 hours later.

---

### Armor
- **Light Armor (Layered Cloth):**  Integrity: 2.
  Layers of conflicting garments grant minimal physical protection, but primarily obscure form and intent allowing the Echo-born to mitigate damage as normal.

---

### Stamina
- total: 3  
  The Echo-Born does not truely tire, bleed, or exhaust, only appear as one might imagine.

---

### Fear
- **varies**:  2-6 or none.
Some variants are assumed to be cowardly, inwhich case it starts at fear level 2.

---

### Skills
The Echo-Born does not possess individual skill ratings.

Instead, it **inherits effectiveness** from consensus:

- When the community agrees the Echo-Born is *strong*, it acts as strong.
- When the community agrees it is *inevitable*, it cannot be easily stopped.
- When the community agrees it is *righteous*, its actions gain moral weight.

Mechanically, the Guide should treat the Echo-Born’s effective skill dice as **matching the dominant narrative**, rather than fixed values.

---

### Actions (RLHF)

**H — Enforce the Narrative**  
A psychic and symbolic pressure forcing characters to act in accordance with the agreed story. Hesitation or contradiction may incur penalties.

**R / L — Manifest Harm**  
Indistinct physical attacks whose damage and intent mirror the consensus accusation (theft, violence, punishment, etc.).

**F — Appear Where Accusation Occurs**  
The Echo-Born may reposition to any location where a public accusation, declaration, or unanimous judgment has just been made.

---

### Traits

**Consensus-Bound**  
The Echo-Born gains effectiveness as long as a single explanation of it dominates. Public contradiction weakens it.

**No Author**  
Effects that target intent, possession, or will have no effect.

**Self-Fulfilling**  
Actions taken because of the Echo-Born strengthen it unless those actions visibly fracture consensus.

---

### Defeat Condition

The Echo-Born is not defeated by damage.

It collapses when:
- no single description of it can be agreed upon.

When this occurs, it dissolves mid-action, leaving only argument, silence, and doubt.

---

### Guide Note

If the players ask, *“What is it really?”*  
The correct answer is:

*“Whatever they were sure it was.”*
