## The RHLF (“Ralph”) Action System

The 24-System uses a **body-anchored action economy** called the **RHLF Action System**, informally known as the **“Ralph” system**.  
Rather than abstract action points, characters commit **parts of their body** to perform actions.

RHLF stands for:

- **L** – Primary Hand (the hand holding the weapon)
- **R** – Secondary Hand (optional or supporting)
- **H** – Head (awareness, targeting, balance, intent)
- **F** – Feet (stance, movement, positioning)

These anchors determine **what actions are possible**, **what bonuses apply**, and **what happens when a character is injured or exhausted**.

### Handedness and Notation

The labels **L** and **R** are **arbitrary** and do **not** represent biological handedness.

- **L** always denotes the *hand currently holding or leading the action*.
- **R** denotes the *supporting hand*, when applicable.
- Left- and right-handed characters function identically.
- The system assumes no inherent advantage to either side.

This convention exists solely to keep action notation compact and readable.

### Action Commitment

Every action specifies which body anchors it requires.

Examples:
- `L` – One-handed action
- `LH` – One-handed action with focus or targeting
- `(R)LHF` – A fully committed martial action using:
  - Primary hand
  - Optional secondary hand (two-handed weapon)
  - Head (awareness, timing)
  - Feet (stance and balance)

**Parentheses indicate optional commitment**, usually for two-handed weapons or heavier techniques.

### Why This Matters

The RHLF system directly connects:
- **Weapon choice**
- **Positioning**
- **Injury**
- **Fatigue**
- **Range control**

If a body anchor is **impaired**, actions that use it suffer penalties.  
If a body anchor is **disabled**, actions that require it are unavailable.

This creates a natural degradation of capability over time without introducing complex tracking or special conditions.

### Design Goals

The RHLF system is designed to:
- Make injuries immediately meaningful
- Reduce abstract action bookkeeping
- Encourage tactical adaptation instead of static optimal play
- Ensure that combat fiction and mechanics always align

Characters are not limited by arbitrary action counts, but by **what their bodies can still do**.
