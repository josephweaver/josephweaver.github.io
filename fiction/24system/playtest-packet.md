# 24-System Player Playtest Packet

The 24-System is a flexible, consequence-forward RPG engine designed to create tension without sudden character collapse. Actions have lasting effects, resources erode over time, and pushing your luck carries risk, but characters remain playable even when things go wrong. The goal is sustained pressure and meaningful choice, not instant death or runaway death spirals.

## 1. What Kind of Game This Is

The **24-System** is a **tactical survival-horror RPG**.

- Combat is about **space, attention, and injury**, not hit point attrition.
- You are assumed to be **competent**.
- Danger escalates through **pressure, fear, and wounds**, not random failure.
- Retreat, preparation, and avoidance are valid successes.

If you try to “solve” the system, it will hurt you.

---

## 2. The Core Loop

On your turn, decide:

1. **What parts of your body are you committing?**
2. **What space are you controlling or giving up?**
3. **What risk are you willing to accept?**

Then:

- The GM sets a **Difficulty (DC)**.
- You roll your dice.
- The **highest die** is your result.
- **Partial Criticals matter more than totals.**

---

## 3. The RHLF Action System (“Ralph”)

Instead of action points, you commit **parts of your body**.

| Anchor | Meaning | Represents |
|------|--------|------------|
| **L** | Primary Hand | Weapons, manipulation |
| **R** | Secondary Hand | Shields, support |
| **H** | Head | Attention, targeting, intent |
| **F** | Feet | Movement, balance, stance |

**Key Rule:**  
If a body part is **injured**, actions using it degrade.  
If it is **disabled**, those actions may be unavailable.

You are limited by **what your body can still do**, not by turns.

---

## 4. Warding & Space Control

### Warding (Automatic)

If you are:
- aware of danger,
- not already engaged,
- and not committing your **Head (H)** elsewhere,

→ **you are automatically warding.**

Warding means:
- you threaten space,
- enemies must contest movement through you,
- warding is **directional and limited**.

### What Breaks Warding

Any action that commits **H**, including:
- attacking,
- aiming,
- casting spells,
- tracking another threat,
- issuing complex commands.

Movement alone does **not** break warding.

---

## 5. Attacking & Defending

### Defense (Reactive)

When attacked, you may choose **one** defense per attack:

- **Dodge (F)** — evade entirely
- **Parry (L)** — redirect (weapon risk)
- **Block (R)** — absorb (shield risk)

Defense is reactive and does not need to be declared in advance.

---

### Common Combat Actions

| Action | Body Used | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Attack | L | Ends warding |
| Focused Attack | L + H | Careful, precise |
| Full Martial Attack | L (R) H F | Maximum commitment |
| Advance | F | Close distance, may be contested |
| Covering Fire | L + H | Forces choices, no damage |

---

## 6. Resolution & Outcomes

You roll dice from your **skill** plus any **Leverage**.

### Possible Outcomes

- **Legendary (24+)**  
  Cinematic success with major effect.

- **Partial Critical (Max Die)**  
  Something extra happens, even if you fail.

- **Success**  
  You achieve your goal cleanly.

- **Success with Complication**  
  You push forward, reroll one die, accept a setback.

- **Failure**  
  You do not get what you want. The situation changes.

Failure always moves the scene forward.

---

## 7. Leverage & Pressure

### Leverage

Good positioning, planning, teamwork, or preparation.

| Leverage | Bonus Die |
|---------|-----------|
| 1 | d4 |
| 2 | d6 |
| 3 | d8 |
| 4 | d10 |
| 5 | d12 |

Roll all dice and take the **highest**.

---

### Pressure

Danger, darkness, fear, injury, time limits.

- Pressure does **not** remove dice.
- Pressure **raises the DC**.

Skill keeps you effective.  
Pressure keeps you unsafe.

---

## 8. Wounds, Stamina, and Injury

- **Stamina** represents short-term exertion and shock.
- **Wounds** are lasting injuries.

Armor may convert wounds into stamina loss.  
Once stamina goes negative, actions degrade.

Injuries:
- reduce movement,
- weaken attacks,
- disrupt strategies.

There is no “fine at 1 HP” state.

---

## 9. Fear

Fear is tracked from **0 to 6**.

Fear does **not** remove agency.  
It **biases decisions**, especially toward caution.

| Fear Level | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1–2 | Alert, cautious |
| 3 | Hesitation when advancing |
| 4 | First hostile action loses one body anchor |
| 5 | Limited to 3 of 4 body anchors |
| 6 | Breakdown or withdrawal |

Fear punishes reckless engagement, not survival.

---

## 10. Weapons & Escalation

Weapons differ by:
- how many body parts they require,
- what happens on **Partial Criticals**.

Examples:
- **Precision** — stamina bleed, armor gaps
- **Chopping** — destroys armor
- **Crushing** — ignores mitigation
- **Reach** — controls space
- **Firearms** — escalation buttons

Bows and guns are parity weapons until crits.  
Crits are terrifying.

---

## 11. Magic (If Present)

Magic always works.  
The roll determines **how dangerous it becomes**.

- Spells never fizzle.
- Failure causes backlash or escalation.
- Magic always costs **attention (H)**.

Magic is powerful, unsafe, and loud.

---

## 12. Character Creation (Quick)

- No attributes.
- Skills determine dice.
- Choose:
  - 1 specialty skill
  - 1 strong skill
  - 2 competent skills
- Choose **2 traits**.

Your character is defined by **what you risk**.

---

## 13. Table Expectations

- Describe intent first.
- Declare body commitment clearly.
- Don’t hunt for optimal builds.
- Retreat is success.
- Ask questions.
- Trust the fiction.

If something is unclear, the GM will rule fast and move on.

---

## Final Note to Players

This system is not here to protect you.

It is here to:
- make danger legible,
- make survival meaningful,
- and make scars matter.

If you walk away alive, it will be because you chose to.
