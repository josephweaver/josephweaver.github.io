# Spellcasting Axioms

- **Magic always works.**
- A spell always produces its *type* of effect:
  - Wards always ward.
  - Summons always summon.
  - Distortions always distort.
- Spell rolls determine **how** the effect manifests, not **whether** it manifests.
- Bad outcomes cause **backlash, escalation, or unwanted consequences**, never null effects.
- Magic never grants ownership or control, only influence.
- Most spells require **Head** and interfere with mundane defense while active.
- Spells cost **stamina** and may cause wounds or attention on poor results.
