# Skills

Skills define **what kinds of actions a character can attempt**, not passive bonuses.  
Each skill grants access to a set of **explicit actions** that players may declare.

To resolve an action, combine:
- One **Skill**
- Situational modifiers
- Wound penalties (by limb)

Roll the combined dice pool against a Difficulty or opposing roll.

Wounds apply disadvantage dice as defined in the Wounds rules. If an action uses multiple limbs, apply only the worst penalty.

## Design Notes

- Skills define **available actions**, not static modifiers.
- Movement and defense are first-class mechanics.
- Injuries degrade capability rather than flipping binary states.
- Partial success and critical outcomes may have social or tactical consequences even when mechanical effects are unchanged.

This document defines the action vocabulary used throughout the system.
