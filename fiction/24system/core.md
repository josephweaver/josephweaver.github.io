## 24-System: Success & Failure Levels

In the 24-System, you roll a pool of dice based on your skill and any situational benefits, then compare your result to a **Difficulty (DC)**.

Your **result** is the **highest single die** rolled, after applying bonuses and Leverage.

---

### Outcome Levels

#### Legendary Success (24+)

If your final result is **24 or higher**, you achieve an extraordinary, cinematic success.

- You bypass normal limitations
- You gain a powerful additional benefit
- The Guide may allow effects beyond the original intent of the action

Legendary results represent moments where preparation, skill, and circumstance align perfectly.

---

#### Partial Critical (Max Die)

If **any die** in your roll shows its **maximum value** (e.g., 12 on a d12, 10 on a d10), you gain a **Partial Critical**, even if you do not reach 24.

Partial Criticals grant a flourish or immediate benefit, such as:

- Acting faster
- Avoiding a minor consequence
- Impressing observers
- Gaining positional advantage
- Reducing the impact of Pressure

Partial Criticals reward strong execution even under difficult conditions.

---

#### Success

If your result **meets or exceeds the DC**, you succeed as intended.

You accomplish your goal cleanly, with no added cost.

---
### Push Your Luck (Optional Reroll)

If you fail a roll, you may choose to **push your luck**.

When you do so:

- You must **accept a Minor Complication** immediately.
- You **reroll the entire dice pool**.
- You must keep the new result.

This represents forcing the action through stress, danger, or desperation.

---

### Outcomes After Pushing

After the reroll, resolve the outcome normally, with the following escalation rules:

- **Reroll Succeeds (meets or exceeds DC)**  
  You succeed, but the **Minor Complication applies**.

- **Reroll Succeeds with a Partial Critical**  
  You gain the Partial Critical benefit, but the **Minor Complication still applies**.

- **Reroll Fails**  
  The failure **escalates into a Critical Failure**.  
  You must take a **Major Complication** instead of a minor one.

Pushing your luck always carries risk, success comes at a cost, failure compounds.

---

### Critical Failure

A **Critical Failure** represents a loss of control caused by escalation, bad positioning, or pushing beyond safe limits.

A Critical Failure occurs when:

- A pushed reroll still fails,
- The Guide declares the situation has escalated beyond safe limits

On a Critical Failure:

- You fail the action
- You must accept a **Major Complication**
- The situation escalates immediately and meaningfully

Critical Failures are not about incompetence, they are about pressure, risk, and consequence.

---

### Miss (No Push)

If your result is below the DC and you **choose not to push**:

- You fail to achieve your goal
- No complication is automatically applied
- The Guide advances the situation naturally

Examples include:

- Time passes
- The environment changes
- Opponents reposition or react
- New information or threats emerge

Failure should move the scene forward, not stall play.

### Minor Complications

Minor Complications represent setbacks, costs, or unintended consequences.

Examples include:

- Dropping or fumbling an item
- Making noise or drawing attention
- Taking minor harm or fatigue
- Losing time or position
- Using up resources
- Leaving evidence behind
- Suffering temporary disorientation

Minor Complications should complicate the situation without stopping play.

---

### Major Complications

Major Complications represent serious consequences or dramatic turns.

Examples include:

- Suffering a wound or lasting injury
- Breaking important gear
- Being discovered or trapped
- Endangering an ally
- Losing a critical resource
- Escalating the threat or alerting powerful enemies

Major Complications always change the situation in a meaningful way.

---

## Leverage & Pressure

The 24-System replaces traditional advantage and disadvantage with **Leverage** and **Pressure**.

This system rewards preparation and smart play, while keeping penalties clear and fair.

---

### Leverage

**Leverage** represents favorable circumstances such as:

- Positioning
- Planning
- Superior tools or gear
- Teamwork
- Surprise or momentum

Each point of Leverage grants a **bonus die**, using the step progression below.

You may gain multiple points of Leverage from different sources.

---

### Leverage Dice Progression

When you have Leverage, add **one bonus die** to your roll:

| Leverage | Bonus Die |
|--------|-----------|
| 1 | d4 |
| 2 | d6 |
| 3 | d8 |
| 4 | d10 |
| 5 | d12 |

Roll all dice together.  
Your result is the **highest single die**.

**Leverage dice are never negative.**  
If circumstances are poor, Pressure applies instead.

---

### Pressure

**Pressure** represents difficulty, danger, or constraint, such as:

- Darkness, smoke, or noise
- Injury, exhaustion, or fear
- Environmental hazards
- Time pressure
- Opposition or resistance

Pressure **does not affect your dice**.

Instead, Pressure **increases the DC** of the action.

---

### Applying Pressure

Each point of Pressure raises the DC by **+1 to +2**, depending on severity.

Typical examples:

- Low light: +1 DC
- Darkness or smoke: +2 DC
- Wounded or exhausted: +2 DC
- Severe injury or panic: +3 or more DC

The Guide should state the adjusted DC clearly before the roll.

---

### Key Principles

- Players only roll extra dice when things are going well
- Difficulty comes from harder targets, not worse dice
- Leverage rewards smart play
- Pressure keeps danger real without killing momentum

This system preserves excitement while maintaining tension and fairness.

---

### Optional Rule: Crushing Pressure

In extreme situations, the Guide may declare **Crushing Pressure**.

- You may not gain Leverage on this roll
- The DC is increased significantly

Use this sparingly, for moments of overwhelming danger.
