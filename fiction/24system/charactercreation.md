# Character Creation (24-System)

Welcome to the **24-System**.  
Character creation is fast, flexible, and focused on what your character can *do*, not on abstract attributes.

There are **no Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence scores**.  
Your **skills, traits, and decisions** define your character completely.

---

## Step 1: Describe Your Character

Before assigning any mechanics, describe who your character is.

- Name
- Age
- Appearance
- Background
- Personality
- Motivation

There are **no restrictions** on body type, upbringing, or origin.  
Use descriptors freely: *broad-shouldered*, *bookish*, *nimble*, *grizzled*, etc. These are narrative, not mechanical.

---

## Step 2: Assign Your Skills

Skills determine the dice you roll whenever you attempt a risky or dramatic action.

### Core Skills

Choose from the following list:

- **Athletics** — climbing, running, swimming, feats of physical prowess
- **Melee** — swords, axes, hand-to-hand combat
- **Ranged** — bows, thrown weapons, firearms
- **Lore** — history, arcana, science, medicine, languages
- **Thievery** — stealth, lockpicking, sleight of hand
- **Social** — persuasion, intimidation, negotiation, performance
- **Magic** — spellcasting, rituals, supernatural knowledge

---

### Skill Dice Assignment

You assign **four skills** at character creation:

- **1 Specialty Skill**  
  `d8 + d10 + 6`

- **1 Strong Skill**  
  `2d10 + 4`

- **2 Competent Skills**  
  `d10 + d12`

All other skills remain **unassigned**.

If you attempt an action using an unassigned skill, roll:

  `2d12`


This is called the **vanilla roll**.

---

### Example

**Jael the Exile**, a clever rogue:

- Thievery: `d8 + d10 + 6` (specialty)
- Social: `2d10 + 4` (strong)
- Athletics: `d10 + d12` (competent)
- Lore: `d10 + d12` (competent)

Melee, Ranged, Magic are unassigned and use `2d12`.
