## Narrative Based Perception

In this game, there’s no Perception stat or automatic search check. Instead, players uncover secrets, traps, and hidden features through their actions and attention to the story.

When you describe your character’s investigations—asking questions, examining the environment, or testing suspicions—the Guide responds with clues based on what your character actually does, what they know, and which skills they use. Sharp observations and clever ideas matter more than a lucky roll.

Pay attention to details in the Guide’s descriptions. Subtle sights, sounds, smells, or textures may hint at secrets or dangers waiting to be discovered.

### Tips for Narrative Discovery (Players)

- **Ask specific questions:**  
  “Does the air feel different near this wall?”  
  “Are there scratches by the lock?”

- **Describe your actions:**  
  Don’t just say “I search the room.” Try:  
  “I tap the flagstones with my staff and run my hand along the wall.”

- **Work together:**  
  Share hunches and combine different skills (Lore, Thievery, Magic) for better results.

- **Stay curious:**  
  Sometimes the smallest detail is the key to finding what others miss.

### Tips for Narrative Discovery (Guide)

- **Always include a clue:**  
  Every secret, trap, or hidden feature should have at least one subtle hint. This might be a scent, draft, odd sound, or visual irregularity.

- **Make clues fit the world:**  
  A hidden library might smell of old paper.  
  A trapped hallway might have a slightly raised flagstone.

- **Reward curiosity, not just skills:**  
  Clever questions and creative interaction should yield useful information, even without the “right” skill.

- **Use multiple senses:**  
  Describe not only what is seen, but also what is heard, smelled, or felt.

- **Layer clues:**  
  Obvious clues reward careful play; deeper clues reward expertise (Lore, Thievery, Magic).

- **Let players connect the dots:**  
  Present clues honestly and allow players to draw conclusions. Do not force solutions.

- **Keep danger fair:**  
  Never spring traps or secrets without foreshadowing. “Gotchas” break trust; hints build tension.

- **Encourage teamwork:**  
  Secrets are easier to uncover when players share information and combine perspectives.


## Secret Doors & Panels

Secret doors and panels are not found through rolls. They are discovered through observation, interaction, and narrative clues. The Guide should always foreshadow their presence through environmental details before a player can uncover or activate them.
