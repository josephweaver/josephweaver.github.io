## Defense Actions (24-System)

When attacked, a defender may choose how to respond. Defense is an **active choice**, not a passive number. Each defense option changes the attacker’s Difficulty Class (DC) and how damage is resolved.

A character may only use a defense that relies on a limb they have not already committed this round.

---

## Base Defense (No Active Defense)

If the defender does nothing special:

- **Attack DC = 13**
- On a hit, damage is applied normally.

This represents the baseline difficulty of striking a moving, aware target in combat.

---

## Parry (Skill-Based Avoidance)

**Skill Used:** Melee  
**Concept:** Weapon skill, timing, redirection

**Effect:**
- **Parry DC = Average of defender’s Melee roll**
- The attack must meet or exceed this DC to hit.

**On a Hit:**
- Damage is **deflected**, not avoided.
- Reduce or redirect damage (GM discretion):
  - −1 wound
  - Damage shifted to weapon or armor integrity
  - Loss of balance or position

**Costs & Risks:**
- No stamina cost
- On Partial Crit or Legendary against a parry:
  - Defender’s weapon may lose integrity
  - Parry may partially fail

Parry represents skillful interference with the attack, not absorbing force.

---

## Dodge (Movement-Based Avoidance)

**Skill Used:** Athletics  
**Concept:** Getting out of the way entirely

**Effect:**
- **Dodge DC = Average of defender’s Athletics roll**
- If the attack fails to meet the DC, **all damage is avoided**.

**Cost:**
- Dodge **always costs stamina**, whether successful or not.
- On failure, stamina is spent and damage is taken.

Notes:
- Dodge is the only defense that fully negates damage.
- Repeated dodging leads quickly to exhaustion and disadvantage.

---

## Block (Interception, Not Avoidance)

**Concept:** Putting something solid in the way

**Attack DC:** **13** (unchanged)

Blocking does **not** make you harder to hit. Instead, it changes *what* is hit.

**On a Hit:**
- Damage is absorbed and converted to stamina loss, similar to armor.
- The block may cause integrity loss to the blocking item.

---

### Blocking With a Shield

Shields provide superior protection.

**Shield Benefit:**
- The **first wound** from a blocked hit is absorbed **for free**
- This first wound costs **no stamina**
- Additional wounds convert to stamina as normal

Shields do not avoid hits, but they dramatically reduce consequences.

---

### Blocking cover



### Blocking Without a Shield

Blocking with an arm,

- No free mitigation
- All damage dealt is to the interposing limb up to its disabled mark.  Excess damage translates to the intended target.

This represents desperate or improvised defense.

---

## Defense Summary Table

| Defense | DC | Avoids Hit? | Damage Handling | Cost |
|------|----|------------|----------------|------|
| None | 13 | No | Full damage | — |
| Parry | Avg Melee | Partial | Deflect / reduce | Integrity risk |
| Dodge | Avg Athletics | Yes | None on success | Stamina |
| Block (shield) | 13 | No | First wound free, rest stamina | None (first wound) |

---

## Design Notes

- **Parry** rewards skill and timing.
- **Dodge** trades safety for exhaustion.
- **Block** accepts the hit to control its consequences.
- **Shields** are powerful but do not replace armor or movement.
- Heavy weapons pressure blocks; multiple attackers overwhelm parries.

Defense is about choices under pressure, not static numbers.


## Cover & Concealment (24-System)

Cover and concealment represent environmental factors that interfere with attacks. They modify the **attack DC** or change how damage is resolved, depending on the situation.

Cover and concealment stack with active defenses (Block, Parry, Dodge) unless stated otherwise.

---

## Concealment

Concealment interferes with perception but does not physically stop attacks.

Examples:
- Smoke, fog, darkness
- Foliage, tall grass
- Visual clutter or partial obscuration

### Ranged Attacks
- **+1 DC** to the attack roll

### Melee Attacks
- Concealment usually has **no effect** in melee.
- Concealment applies in melee only if it meaningfully interferes with awareness or movement (GM discretion), such as:
  - Pitch darkness
  - Blinding smoke
  - Deep water or heavy mud

When applicable:
- **+1 DC**

Concealment never absorbs damage.

---

## Cover

Cover physically interposes something between attacker and defender. How it works depends on whether the attack is **ranged** or **melee**, and on the type of cover used.

---

### Ranged Cover

Cover affects ranged attacks by making the target harder to hit.

#### Passive Cover
Cover exists, but the defender is not actively positioning behind it.

Examples:
- Door frames
- Furniture
- Low walls
- Vehicles

Effect:
- **+1 DC**

#### Active Cover (Using Legs – L)
The defender deliberately positions themselves behind cover.

Requirements:
- Commit **Legs (L)** for the round

Effect:
- **+2 DC**

If the defender moves or is forced out of position, active cover is lost.

---

### Melee Cover

In melee, cover works differently. Cover only helps if it is actively used.

---

#### Interposed Objects (Tables, Doors, Carts, Shields)

These function like blocking.

Requirements:
- Commit **one arm (L or R)**

Effect:
- Attack DC is unchanged
- Damage is absorbed or converted, as with a block
- The object may lose integrity or break

Notes:
- Shields absorb the first wound for free (no stamina cost)
- Other objects convert wounds to stamina and risk integrity loss

If no arm is committed:
- The object provides **no benefit** against melee attacks

---

#### Structural Cover (Walls, Corners, Pillars)

Structural cover provides protection through positioning, not interception.

Requirements:
- Commit **Legs (L)** to maintain position

Effect:
- **+1 DC** against melee attacks
- Structural cover does **not** absorb damage
- No arm is required

This represents controlling angles, footing, and approach lanes.

---

#### Total Cover

If the structure fully blocks access:

- The attack **cannot be made**
- The attacker must reposition, grapple, force the defender out, or attack the structure

---

## Stacking Cover with Defense

Cover and concealment stack with active defenses.

Examples:
- Ranged attack against a dodging target in active cover:
  - Base DC 13
  - +2 DC (active cover)
  - +Athletics DC (Dodge)

- Melee attack against a defender pressed into a corner and parrying:
  - Base DC 13
  - +1 DC (structural cover)
  - +Melee DC (Parry)

---

## Design Notes

- Concealment affects perception, not force.
- Cover at range avoids hits; cover in melee controls consequences.
- Objects are blocked with arms; structures are leveraged with legs.
- Cover buys time, not safety.

Positioning matters. Choices matter. Terrain matters.
