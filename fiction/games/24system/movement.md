## Movement (Playtest Rules)

### Movement Rate (MR)
- Base MR for an unencumbered human: **6**
- MR is the maximum distance moved using one **Leg action**
- MR cannot drop below **1** unless immobilized

---

### Armor & Packs
Apply **only the single worst penalty** from armor or pack.

**Armor**
- No / Light: no penalty
- Medium: −1 MR
- Heavy: −2 MR

**Packs**
- No / Light Pack: no penalty
- Medium Pack: −1 MR
- Heavy Pack: −2 MR

---

### Heavy Pack Restrictions
- A pack may be doffed as a **Hand action**
- While wearing a **Heavy Pack**:
  - You cannot **sprint**, **leap**, or perform **acrobatic movement**
  - MR penalties still follow the non-stacking rule

---

### Using Movement
- Spending your **Leg action** allows movement up to MR
- Movement may be split before or after other actions
- An unused Leg action counts as unused defense

---

### Sprinting
- Spend **1 stamina** to gain **+2 MR** for that movement
- Sprinting is not allowed while wearing a **Heavy Pack**
- Sprinting may be used only during your own turn

---

### Engagement & Movement
- You **cannot freely move** while adjacent to an enemy
- Attempting to do so allows the enemy to spend a **defense action**
- To avoid this, you must use an **action skill** (e.g. shove, tumble, feint)
  - These are not movement and are resolved separately

---

### Dangerous Terrain
- Dangerous terrain requires an **Athletics check** to traverse safely
- DC is set by the substance or hazard
- Failure may result in falling, slipping, or other consequences

---

### Difficult Terrain
- Difficult terrain reduces MR or forces a Dangerous Terrain check
- Effects are determined by the environment

---

### Injuries
- Each **leg injury** reduces MR by **1**
- Effects are cumulative

---

### Crits During Movement
- **Partial Crit:** You may ignore enemy defense actions during the movement
- **Double Crit:** Same effect, but you look extremely impressive
- Crits do not increase distance or negate terrain consequences

### Movement Techniques
While using your **Leg action** for movement, you may incorporate any of the following as part of the same movement:
- **Tumble**
- **Leap**
- **Sprint**
- **Navigate terrain**
- **Move stealthily**

These do not require separate actions, but may:
- Trigger **contested rolls**,
- Require **Athletics or Stealth checks**,
- Provoke **defense actions** if performed while adjacent to enemies,
- Be restricted by armor, packs, injuries, or terrain.

The Leg action represents continuous body movement, not a single step.
