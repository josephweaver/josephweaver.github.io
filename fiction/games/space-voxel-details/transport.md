# Tier-1 Logistics: Autonomous Transport and Player Engagement

## Overview

With Tier-1 technology, mining, refining, and just-in-time (JIT) delivery are autonomous systems.  
The primary remaining bottleneck is **transport**, which becomes the first major piece of player-built infrastructure.

Transport is where:
- gravity
- environment
- risk
- timing  
become real gameplay constraints.

This preserves exploration, avoids megastructure escalation, and supports conservation-focused design.

## Core Principle

> **Explorers do not move worlds, they move intent.**

Transport ships are extensions of planning and coordination, not brute-force hauling platforms.

---

## Transport Engagement Lanes

The game supports multiple levels of player engagement without forcing complexity.

### Lane A: Stock Transports (Low Engagement)

Designed for players who want:
- exploration
- narrative
- forward progression without heavy system design

**Properties**
- Pre-certified hulls
- Known performance envelopes
- Conservative safety margins
- Lower efficiency ceiling

**Design Goals**
- Zero friction entry
- No progression blocking
- Failures feel fair, not punitive

---

### Lane B: Modified Stock and Wreck-Derived Transports (Medium Engagement)

The primary learning and experimentation path.

**Spacewrecks**
- Found in hazardous or advanced regions
- Implicitly demonstrate viable transport designs
- Encode environmental constraints and past failures

**Gameplay Loop**
1. Discover wreck
2. Scan structure and damage
3. Identify failure points
4. Repair or modify key systems
5. Rebuild using available materials
6. Test under local conditions

**Benefits**
- Reverse engineering as tutorial
- Environmental storytelling
- Incremental understanding without spreadsheets

---

### Lane C: Fully Custom Transports (High Engagement)

For players who enjoy:
- optimization
- systems thinking
- operating near safety margins

**Characteristics**
- Highest efficiency potential
- Sensitive to prediction errors
- Strongly coupled to JIT accuracy

This lane is optional but defines the performance frontier.

## Transport Design Constraints (Soft Limits)

To prevent planet-eaters and megastructures without banning them:

- **Nonlinear thrust-to-mass penalties**
  - Large ships suffer exponentially in gravity wells
- **Risk concentration**
  - Failures scale catastrophically with size
- **JIT efficiency bias**
  - Small, frequent deliveries outperform bulk hauling

Result:
- Fleets over leviathans
- Redundancy over monoliths
- Specialization over general-purpose designs

---

## Failure Model

Transport failure is informative, not purely punitive.

- Partial cargo recovery is possible
- Flight data improves future predictions
- Wrecks persist as future learning sites

Failure feeds the system rather than resetting progress.

---

## Design Rules

- **No transport design is strictly optimal in all contexts**
- Every hull is environment- and route-specific
- Larger scale increases risk faster than capability
- Conservation is enforced through logistics, not prohibitions

---

## Narrative Alignment

Transport reflects explorer philosophy:
- precision over domination
- coordination over consumption
- temporary interfaces with planetary systems

Megastructures are discouraged naturally through uncertainty, risk, and inefficiency rather than artificial limits.
