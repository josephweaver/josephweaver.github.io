# Overview
This project is a personal knowledge base and blog that encompasses various topics including probability theory, research papers, and fictional writings. The content is organized in a way that allows for easy navigation and retrieval of information.  The content is primarily written in markdown format, making it accessible and easy to edit.  

When saved to my GitHub repository, the project is rendered as a static website using Jekyll, allowing for seamless browsing of the content, accessible at [https://josephweaver.github.io/](https://josephweaver.github.io/).
